This is spl, a program for handling spells and spellbooks
from various fantasy role-playing (FRP) games.  It can handle
both mage and priest spells for TSR's AD&D (a trademark of TSR, inc)
game, and can easily be expanded to handle other systems as well.
In addition to possibly being useful to FRP players and
GM's, the source may be useful to OS/2 2.x programmers learning
about containers, MLE's, and PM programming in general.
