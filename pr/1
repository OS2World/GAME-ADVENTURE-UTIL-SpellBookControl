Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 12" + 1" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the cleric to call all animals or birds within the
spell effect.  The animals or birds will converge upon the cleric
within 1d3 rounds.  While the spell is in effect, none of the animals
or birds will attack each other.  While there, the cleric may set one
small task for the group to perform.  When the spell ends, the animals
or birds will peacefully disperse to whence they came.

Animal Enmity (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell simply causes the victim to be offensive to animals for the
period of one day. Horses will shy or buck, dogs will bark, bulls will
charge, birds will aim at them, etc. Note that animals with a close
association to the victim won't do anything to hurt the victim, they'll
just treat him like you would treat a friend who, for some reason,
smelled horrible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animal Tracks (Alteration, Enchantment)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the cleric to leave tracks & scents as as the animal
specified during casting.  The tracks have traces of magic for 3 turns,
after which they are indistinguishable from normal tracks.  Only
non-mythical creatures can be impersonated.  A holly berry and some fur
from the animal to be impersonated is needed to cast this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coalstone (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 turns
Area of Effect: One gem
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric enchants a gem, turning it into a
coalstone.  The coalstone glows and gives of heat.  It is hot enough to
start a fire, ignite flammable substances and sheds light in a 5'
radius.  Holding the coalstone will inflict 1 hit point of damage per
round unless the wielder possesses some form of protection.  The
coalstone will burn for 1 day per GP value of the gem used for a
maximum of 1 year per level of the caster, after which the coalstone
crumbles into a fine powder.  Another function of the coalstone is that
the caster may opt to cause it to explode.  This will cause 1 point of
concussion damage for every 100 days left on the duration (save for +)
and ignite any flammables within a 5' radius.  The material component
for the spell is the gem to be enchanted and a sprig of holly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comprehend Languages (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conjured Weapon (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One weapon
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it brings into existence a weapon of the
caster's choice which he can use to fight with. The weapon is a normal
weapon with the holy symbol of the god engraved upon it. The weapon has
a dim glow upon it which can be faintly seen. The caster, if he is to
use the weapon, must be proficient in its use. The weapon can be given
to another character to use.

If a striking spell is used in conjugation with the conjured weapon
spell, then there will be an additional +1 to hit and to damage rolls
because of the cumulative effects of the magic of the spells. The
conjured weapon then counts as a +2 weapon for purposes of special
defense.

The weapon stays into existence until the end of the spell or until the
caster wishes the spell to end.

The verbal component would sound something like, "Oh Great Warrior Kos,
give me a broadsword to smite down my foes!", then the gestures made
are those to signify the casters intent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create Earth (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning
Range: 1"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster creates up to 3 pounds per level of stone or
1 cubic foot per level of sand, dirt, or dust. The stone can be solid
or lose gravel. The reverse, Destroy Earth, will destroy a like amount
of earth or stone. Magical creatures are allowed a save vs. magic or
take 1 point damage per level of the caster.

The material component is the cleric's holy symbol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daryana's Holy Shit (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Creation
Range: 10'
Components: V
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 3-inch radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell was granted to Daryana, third level priestess of the goddess
of magic, after she had repeatedly, loudly, requested it.

Upon uttering the verbal component - already mentioned in the spell's
name - two things can happen. If cast consciously, the spell can be
targeted and takes effect immediately. In this case, some faeces appear
anywhere within the range of the spell.

If this spell was memorised, and cast unconsciously, the spell's effect
is delayed for up to 1 hour while the place of impact is anywhere
within 10' around the unfortunate caster, both at the DM's discretion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Enemy (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the cleric may determine whether there are
creatures within the area of effect that bear hostile intent toward
him.  The spell will reveal the direction of the creatures, even if
they are invisible, ethereal, astral, or out of phase.  Note that this
spell does not reveal anything about the alignment or motives of the
creatures in concern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dieme's Forcing Hand (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

By this spell, the caster throws a stone hand at the target. The stone
hand will then make a crackling noise and show blue lightning as it
flies towards its target. When it hits, it will do 2 points per level
of impact damage. Upon casting this spell, the caster throws the hand
and says "to arms". This spell (like "magic missile") always hits.

The material component is a carved (or created) stone hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dispel Fatigue (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell removes fatigue from the affected creature and protects it
from tiring further for the spell duration.  However, once the spell
expires, the recipient must rest for the amount of time spent in
strenuous activity (i.e., running, melee combat) while under the
spell.  No damage sustained is restored, including broken or sprained
limbs, i.e., you still can't run on a sprained ankle.  The spell is
also ineffective against magically or psionically caused fatigue (such
as Ray of Enfeeblement), or against subdual damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Faithfulness (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Guardian, Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell acts as a Phylactery of Faithfulness in that it will alert
the cleric to any action or item which will adversely affect his
alignment and standing with his deity, if a prior moment is taken to
contemplate the action. Furthermore, if the cleric is forced by some
form of possession or domination to act contrary to alignment, the
spell bestows a 10% chance per level of breaking free of the mind
control, as well as a saving throw to not carry out the offending act.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flame Tongue (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One or more persons listening
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell grants the caster the ability of fast talking: during the
spell's duration, the caster is able to talk and talk and talk, thus
gaining the undivided attention of those listening, provided they can
understand the caster. Note that all hearing the caster will be
affected by this fast talking: party members are affected too.

The second use of this spell is to increase the morale of hirelings,
followers and henchmen: prior to a fight, the priest can encourage them
by talking vividly for one round, thus increasing their morale by two
points plus one for every two levels above first, up to a maximum of 5.
Thus, a fifth or sixth level priest will increase the morale by 4
points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gnat Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: Sight
Components: S, M
Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The cleric can summon a swarm of gnats to bother and harass the victim
for the duration of the spell.

For example: a man is stalking Bob-the-wonder-druid through the
forest.  The fellow gets closer than Bob would like, and, unless he
acts fast, is liable to get spotted (a situation he'd like to avoid.)
The man has a 30% chance to spot Bob normally, but with the swarming
gnats, his attention is elsewhere, so his chances are cut to 15%.
The material component for this spell is a dead gnat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grow (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One plant
Saving Throw: None

The cleric can cause a single plant to show a week's worth of growth in
one day. This spell can be cast at most once per day per plant. The
material component for this spell is some furtiliser or humus, and some
water, to be given to the plant (the components are not consumed by the
spell, but they are by the plant). If the cleric wishes to continually
cast this spell, then he should be prepared to furnish additional
fertiliser and water to sustain the plant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guardian Watch (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a small quasi-earth-elemental (1d4 HP) to stand
watch. If some creature moves across or under the ground into the area
of effect that weighs more than 1 pound, the elemental will cause the
ground to shiver and wake people up (detection of creatures is by
movement and vibrations across the ground). The elemental can also form
a hand and try to trip intruders (the guardian is semi-intelligent and
can remember simple commands from the caster, i.e. like who the party
members are). The guardian is hard to detect and will almost always
trip from surprise. Opponents get a save vs. magic to avoid tripping -
a save means they just felt something trying to grab their leg.

The material components of this spell are the cleric's holy symbol and
a live worm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Itch (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Causes the victim to have an irresistible urge to scratch, if he, she
or it fails its saving throw. This can be cast on any sort of animal
that might have to scratch, and dogs save at -4.  This spell works with
embarrassing effectiveness on armoured folks.  The actual location of
the itch is semi-random (i.e. GM rolls a dice, pretends it matters,
then does whatever (s)he likes). Most of the time, though, it's on the
back, the foot, or, on the odd occasion, less appropriate places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Step (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows one creature to be able to run at full speed without
getting tired over stone, dirt, or grass.  At the end of the duration,
the creature must stop for 1 turn for each hour it was running.  During
this time it can do nothing except drink liquids and small, light
portions of food. At the end of this resting period, the creature will
start to regain enough energy to be able to carry on normal activities
(i.e. eat, walk, etc.).  When the creature has stopped for a time equal
to the time it ran, it will be able to carry on all activities without
penalty (i.e. fight, run, etc.).  This spell will work on horses, pack
animals, etc.

The material component for this spell is a small piece of leather.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request Animal (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One animal
Saving Throw: Special

By casting this spell, a cleric can ask a particular animal for a
favour.  The caster must have some sort of enticement for the animal to
actually perform the favour, because the animal can opt not to carry
out the cleric's wishes. The casting time of this spell is 1 plus the
time necessary to make the request, which may take no longer than one
turn. This spell does not empower the priest to actually speak the
animal's language.

For example: If a cleric spotted an owl, the cleric could request the
owl to, if it saw any other humanoids around, fly back and alert the
cleric.  An appropriate offering might be some choice part of a rabbit,
a mouse, or some other form of owl snack food. If the owl was actually
required to fly patrol all night (and forego hunting, a favourite owl
activity) then probably the owl would turn him down no matter what the
cleric offered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock-Jump (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Creation
Range: 100 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the cleric can cause a rock to find its way into the
shoe of the victim. If the victim has no shoes, the spell causes a
thorn or something to stick into the foot of the victim. The material
component for this spell is a small stone of thorn, that is to be
thrown in the direction of the victim. It is consumed in the victim's
shoe or foot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seedling (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes one tree seed or seedling per level of the caster to
be specially blessed by the caster's god. When the spell is cast upon a
seed or seedling and planted in the ground, it will immediately start
to grow at an astonishing rate. It will grow to a total height of 2'+ 1
foot per level of the caster in the period of one turn. A tree thus
"blessed" by this spell will grow to be a large, healthy tree, highly
resistant to both parasites and disease, and will have a much longer
lifespan than the ordinary trees of its type.

The reverse of this spell, tree shrink, causes one tree to be reduced
in height by the above amount. If this is cast upon a "monster" tree
then it gets a save vs. spells. If the tree saves, there is no effect.
If the tree fails, then the tree is reduced in HD by the level of the
caster.

The spell can be cast in two ways. The first way takes 1 round per seed
or seedling to cast and be planted. The other way takes 9 segments per
seed or seedling to cast. The spell is then finished at a later time by
completing the final gestures (1 segment per seed or seedling) and then
planting the seeds or seedlings. There is no limit to the time in
between the original casting and completion in this variation. Anybody
can complete the final gestures needed to complete this spell.

The seeds or seedlings are most commonly used for gifts or
reforestation projects as needed. The trees around a cleric grove tend
to be of this type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sense Direction (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By use of this spell, the cleric is able to divine exactly what
direction his home grove is in relation to his current position.  Only
direction is known, not distance.  The component for this spell is a
oak leaf (from the home grove) suspended by a spider silk thread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharpleaf (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 2"
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 3 leaves per 4 levels
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the cleric causes oak leaves to become rigid and
extremely sharp.  These Sharpleaves can now be wielded or thrown as
daggers.  If the leaves are crumbled before the spell is cast, then the
resulting pieces are similar to caltrops, doing 1d2 points each.  One
leaf can cover 5' square, with 1d4 hitting the first creature to
enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Striking (Invocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One weapon per 4 levels
Saving Throw: None

The use of this spell calls down upon a specially consecrated weapon of
a believer, the benediction of his deity.  This spell only works for
those of the same faith as the caster and the weapons used must have
been previously dedicated to that deity through a Ceremony spell.  Once
these conditions have been met, the spell endows the weapon with a
glowing, magical aura that inflict an additional 1d6 points of damage
per blow struck.  This additional damage will affect creatures that are
struck only by magic weapons of +2 or less (while the weapon itself may
do no damage to these creatures).  Note: this spell will not affect
weapons which are +2 or better.  The material components are the
cleric's (un)holy symbol and the consecrated weapon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracker (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 1' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 hours per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to place an enchantment on an object. The
caster will then know, for the duration, the direction and relative
distance to the object. The object can be up to a mile away before the
spell fades away. The spell will last until the spell duration expires
or it is dispelled. If the object is on a unknowing recipient at the
time of casting, then (and only then) does the carrier get a save.

The material component is the object to be tracked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trance (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: S
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 yards radius area
Saving Throw: None

The cleric goes into a meditative trance, and, after being in this
trance for one round, can feel the presence of the spirits in the area
-- including the spirits of the animals in the area.

For example: If, say, a troll happened to be within 100 yards of the
caster, the caster would certainly know that something large and fell
is in the area, but, unless the caster had come into contact with the
spirit of a troll before, wouldn't know what it was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trip (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 100 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One 10-foot per level long square
Saving Throw: None

Actually, this is a low-budget Entangle spell. However, the
effectiveness of this spell depends upon the amount of underbrush in
the area of effect.  In a bramble of thorn-bushes, it is as effective
as an entangle spell.  On a putting green, it has no effect at all.
