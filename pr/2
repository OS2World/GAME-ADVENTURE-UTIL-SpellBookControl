Bat Sense (Divination, Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it enables the recipient to be able to sense
objects, creatures, etc. around him as a bat would (i.e. by the
reflection of sound waves). To use this ability, the recipient must
spend one round "switching" his sensory input. While using this
capability, he must keep his eyes closed. This spell will reduce a
thief's move silently percentages by 50%. Also invisible creatures
may be "seen" using this spell.

The recipient can "see" things up to 60' away from him.

When using this ability, if the recipient is within the effect of a
shout spell, horn of blasting, or similar phenomenon, then he must make
a save versus death or be stunned for 1d6 rounds and have a 40% chance
of becoming deaf (eardrum ruptures).

Command II (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 3" + 1" per level (and within hearing range)
Components: V
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an improved version of the Command spell (see the first
level priest spell Command). The differences are: the range (as noted
above), the duration (as noted above), and that only those creatures
with a 15 and above intelligence or 6 HD get a save.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cure Moderate Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent form of Cure Light Wounds. When the caster
lays his hands upon the creature to be touched the spell cures 3-17
(2d8+1) HP of damage.

The reverse of this spell, cause moderate wounds, does the above amount
of damage if the caster succeeds in touching the victim.

Otherwise this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Invisibility 15' Radius (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is the same as the second level
magic-user spell, Detect Invisibility. Note the spell allows only the
cleric to see invisible creatures, and only those within the specified
radius. The material component of this spell is a pinch of any fine
powder such as talc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Phase (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the person touched can see and perceive any
creature that is out of or in a different phase than that of the spell
recipient. This means that the person touched will see clearly such
creatures with special defenses such as displacement, blinking,
duo-dimension, astral, or etherealness and those who can shift out of
phase, such as a phase spider. Furthermore, if the person touched has
means to attack such creatures, he will have none of the ill effects
that normally occur when trying to attack (i.e. the person touched
would know the exact location of a displacer beast, or where the phase
spider is etc.). The information cannot be communicated to his fellows
by words.

The material component of this spell requires, in addition to the
caster's holy symbol, a lens of calcite crystal which must be viewed
through for the spell to have effect. It does not disappear at the end
of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Style (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One or more creatures
Saving Throw: Special

This spell has two uses: if cast on more than one creature, this spell
will make the one, highest in rank, known to the caster. If all
creatures, which must be in sight, are of equal rank, or there is a tie
for the highest rank, no one will be detected. Note that the highest in
rank need not be the most powerful of the scanned creatures. In this
case, there is no applicable saving throw.

The second use of this spell is to determine the exact rank of a
specific creature: if the spell is cast on one creature only, the
caster will know the rank of the targeted creature. If the caster is
unfamiliar with the hierarchical structure of the victim's society or
organisation, he will only feel a general indication: something like
"no rank", "officer" or "very high rank" would be appropriate
descriptions. Note that nothing is revealed about the victim's level of
experience e.a. The target gets a saving throw, that will negate the
spell.

Dieme's Forceful Hand (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 4" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is like the first level spell except the fist is a lot
larger (about 6' high) and more forceful. The base damage is 2d6 +1 per
level for small or medium, and 3d6 + 1 per level for large creatures.
The creature saves for 1/2 damage, and those that fail are affected as
follows:

 Large: Creature falls down.
 Medium: Creature pushed back 4+1d4 feet, Dex check to stay on feet.
 Small: Creature thrown back the number of feet equal to the damage
 	they took. They also take another 1d6 points of damage when
 	they land.

This spell does not insure a safe landing, and if the creature is in a
position where a fall would do extra damage, like mounted on a horse
for example, extra damage may occur.

The material component is a carved (or created) stone hand.

Efembe's Spitting Image (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2

Duration: 1 week per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Upon casting this spell, the caster spits on his fingertips and smears
some spittle on the target's forehead. This bestows a curse on the
victim: every time he looks into a mirror or another reflecting surface
during the spell's duration, his mirror image will spit into his face.
Note that a Remove Curse will dispel this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat, Creation
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3' long, sword-like blade
Saving Throw: None

or a freezing icicle to spring forth from his hand. This blade is
actually wielded as if it were a scimitar (but it is not a scimitar),
and is the cleric scores a successful hit while employing the blade,
the creature struck will take 2d6 points of damage - with a damage
bonus of +2 if the creature is especially vulnerable to that attack
form (i.e.  fire vs. undead, ice para-elementals and frost vs. red
dragons or fire elementals). The flame blade will ignite combustible
materials. The blade will not affect creature that can be hit by magic
weapons except with respect to undead monsters. In addition to
mistletoe, the cleric must have a leaf of sumac in order to cast this
spell.

This spell causes the healing benefits of sleep to be threefold (i.e.
3 HP per day rested). Additionally this spell causes any and all
curative spells cast during its duration to have maximum effect plus 1

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the cleric's movements to become completely silent
for the duration of the spell. All sounds made by his equipment from
the neck down are muted into inaudibility. Intentional shouting or
spell casting can be heard, and will negate the inaudibility for the
duration of said noise. Attacking completely negates the spell effect
(Cf. Invisibility). The material component is a piece of sea sponge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm, Healing, Protection

than crawling. The material component for this spell is a bucket.

The reverse of this spell removes nausea or protects a character from
such things as Stinking Clouds and seasickness for 1 turn per level of
the caster. The material component for the reverse is some food.

The reverse of this spell belongs to the Abjuration school, while
Nausea itself belongs to the Enchantment/Charm school.

(but he cannot say what plane is on the other side).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection from Charm, 10' Radius (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in operation, all creatures in the area of effect
have a percentage immunity to all forms of charm (spell, item, or
whatever) equal to 20% plus 5% per level of the cleric. Thus, if cast
by a 5th level cleric, any creature in the area of effect targeted by a
charm spell would not need to make a saving throw if 45% or lower was
rolled on percentile dice. The material component is a miniature cloth
blindfold.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell gives +4 on all saving throws versus gaze weapons for each
creature touched. Note: this does not apply to beings whose gaze

or smoked glass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, hold spells and
dragon induced fear paralysis.

This spell does not remove paralysis already in effect, it just
prevents the recipient from being paralysed in the future.

The material component of this spell is a feather, and an infusion of
tea and ginger which is consumed by the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specialisation (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster's weapon
Saving Throw: None

When the specialisation spell is cast, a small part of their god's
power is invested into themselves. This power allows the caster to
fight better in combat. The benefit the caster receives is
specialisation in the god's preferred weapon, if the god has one.
Otherwise the benefits apply to a weapon of the caster's choice. This
specialisation occurs whether or not the caster is proficient with the
weapon. There are no minuses to hit because of non- weapon proficiency
penalties. (Note: Clerics will tend to be proficient with their god's
preferred weapon.)

This spell is typical of spell given to clerics of warrior gods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stone Message (Invocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 minute
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The caster casts this spell directly into the prism on his holy symbol
(this spell was created for a diety whose symbol is a hand grasping a
prism). The caster then names (not by truename) the person he wants to
talk to. If this target person is within 1" of a holy symbol to the
same diety (thus that holy symbol also has a prism in it), then the
target person will notice that the prism flashes. Only the target
person will notice the flashes of light. When the target person touches
the holy symbol, the prism will show the face of the caster, and the
caster's prism will show the face of the target person. The caster can
then talk into his prism and hold a short conversation with the target
person.

If the target person is not within 1" of a specified holy symbol, the
caster will feel like the spell was a dud. The spell will wait one
minute for the person answer. If the person did not answer, the caster
will know that the person did not answer.

Idle chatter is not being appreciated by the diety (noise pollution on
his holy waves). Quick conversations are appreciated. There is also a
5% chance that someone or something associated with the diety (one of
his clerics or minions) will notice and remember the conversation.
This does not mean the cleric or minion will do anything, just that
others may be listening in.

The material components for this spell are the two needed holy symbols,
and are obviously not consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One 1" per level long, 2" per level wide at base cone
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is intended for those times an army is racing toward you in
a charge. Each creature in the cone will have to save vs. spell or
come to a sudden full stop as if it ran into a solid wall (no damage
is caused, they just stop). For the rest of the duration, those that
did not save can not move towards caster. Those that did make their
save can move towards the caster only at half rate.

To cast this spell, the cleric puts his open hand forward and yells
stop (like a traffic cop).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summon Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 3" + 1" per level above fifth
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per level above third
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius sphere
Savings Throw: None

This spell is similar to Insect Plague, but the insects summoned are of
a specific type (with specific effects) depending on the cleric's
deity, for example:

 Deity		Insect	Effect
 ---------	-------	---------------------------------------------
 Beelzebub	Flies	15% + 2% per level chance of causing disease
 Seth		Locusts	2 HP per round to creatures caught in swarm +
 			infestation of food.

For other effects, see the fifth level cleric spell Insect Plague.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracking (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the casting cleric is temporarily endowed with
tracking ability similar to that of a ranger. However the tracking
spell is better. Using this spell, the cleric becomes not only aware of
all physical traces, but psychic traces too. Thus a creature who has
travelled using pass without trace. This makes almost anything
trackable, even aerial creatures (those who leave strong enough psychic
impressions at least). There are some restrictions though. The cleric
must have an item that belonged to the creature being tracked.
Furthermore tracking with this spell must begin at a point that the
creature has been within the past half hour. The other component for
the spell is mistletoe of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unentangle (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One person per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Special

An unentangle spell is used to allow creatures to pass through an
entangle spell cast by the same caster. If the spell is used to pass
another caster's entangle spell then the effects are as follows: normal
movement if a save vs. spells is made or 1/2 normal movement if the
saving throw fails.

This spell also allows normal movement through the densest of forests,
briar thickets, wall of thorns, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weakness (Abjuration, Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This is a defensive spell which causes the target creature to lose (0-3
+ 1 per level of the caster) points of strength. The creatures strength
cannot be lowered past 3 due to the effects of the spell. If the
creature has exceptional strength, then the loss of strength is on a
10% per point ratio. A strength of 18/01 to 18/09 will drop to 18
before dropping to 17.

Creatures, who are successfully subjected to this spell, will tend to
lose the urge to attack the caster if their strength is dropped an
appreciable amount.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild Deer Speed (Alteration, Enchantment)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers the speed of a deer upon the spell caster. It
allows the cleric to increase his running rate (double normal movement
speed, usually 18" or 24") by 1" per 2 levels of the cleric.  Also,
while under this spell's effect, the cleric does not become fatigued or
winded by running at such a fast pace. Furthermore, the cleric can leap
forward for 10' + 1' per level when running. The material component for
this spell is mistletoe plus a chip of deer's hoof.
