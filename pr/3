Aura of Nature (Abjuration, Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1-12 HD of undead per level
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, it surrounds the caster with an overwhelming
aura of life. This aura is comforting to woodland creatures (+25% on
reaction roles) for it is the sensation of life which puts the animals
at ease with the caster.

This, however, is not the principle purpose for the spell. Its primary
use is to turn undead. Undead creatures find this sensation emanating
from the caster's aura very distasteful. When undead encounter this
sensation, they are usually repulsed. This occurs if the caster
succeeds in turning undead as a cleric does. If the die roll "to turn
undead" does not succeed then the undead are not repulsed.

The caster's level is the level used to determine the effect of the
turning. This is only the case if the caster is in natural
surroundings (such as forest, underground caverns and caves, or plains
etc.).

If the caster in in his own consecrated grove, then the caster gets a
+4 modifier to the die roll to turn undead and in addition is allowed
to turn twice the normal number of undead.

If the caster is in an unnatural surrounding (such as buildings or the
astral and ethereal planes of existence) then he turns undead as a
cleric two levels lower then his current level. This is because the
influence of nature is reduced in these surroundings (note: in some
man-made surroundings there may not be a reduction because of the
circumstances - a man-made garden for example).

Berserker (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One believer per level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it invokes the caster's deity to instill
battle madness upon his followers. This causes them to turn into
berserkers. When in this state they only attack enemies and not each
other or their allies.

The effects of this state gives the warriors a large moral bonus (+60),
a to hit/damage bonus (+1/+2), and additional attacks per round
(+1/2).

The major restriction for this spell is that the recipients of this
spell must be true followers of the caster's god. Also they will tend
to fight until the spell finishes or there is a severe morale failure.

This spell is used exclusively by warrior clerics.

Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing

Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of cure moderate wounds. The spell
cures (or causes) 6-27 (3d8+3) hit points per application. Otherwise
this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds spell.

Dhalkuir's Diametric Abjuration (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Weapon touched
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the cleric causes a single weapon to have a
+1/+3 to hit/damage bonus when used against creatures whose alignment
is opposed to that of the cleric.  Thus, if a lawful good cleric cast
the spell, neutral evil, chaotic evil, and chaotic neutral creatures
would be affected.  In the case of a neutral good cleric, opposing
alignments are lawful/neutral/chaotic evil, and so on for other
clerics.  If the concerned creature attempts to touch the weapon, it
takes damage equal to one point per level of the spell caster (half if
a save is made).  In the case of outer-plane creatures, the to
hit/damage bonus is +3/+5.

Etherealness (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Astral
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2 people per 3 levels maximum
Saving Throw: Negates

The priest can take himself and others into the Border Ethereal. From
there the travellers are on their own (DM's, you may want to read the
Dungeon Master's Guide, second edition, or the Manual of the Planes).
The reverse can force a creature out ot the Border Ethereal into your
plane. Naturally this spell fails if the Ethereal Plane is not
reachable. Anyone touched by the caster, as long as within the area of
effect (see above), is also drawn into the Border Ethereal. Unwilling
victims are allowed a saving throw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heat (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range : 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1/2" radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes excitation of air molecules so as to make them emit
heat.  The heat thus created is equal to that of a small fire in
intensity, but its sphere is limited to 1" in diameter.  It lasts for
the duration indicated, or until the caster utters a word to extinguish
the heat.  The heat will melt 1/12' of ice per round.  The spell can
take effect wherever the caster directs as long as he has a line of
sight or unobstructed path for the spell.

If this spell is cast on a creature, the applicable magic resistance
and saving throw dice rolls must be made.  Success indicates that the
the spell takes affects the area immediately behind the creature,
rather than the creature itself.  Failure indicates that the target
creature will take 2 points of damage per melee round from the heat
unless some means of protection from heat is available.  The material
component for the spell is a tinder box and some wood shavings.  Fire
resistance (potion or ring) totally negates the effects of a heat
spell, as will immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice
storm spell.

Lion's Claw (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric causes his fingernails to grow and
thicken into claws.  He is able to attack with these claws twice a
round, doing 1d4+1 points of damage each plus strength bonuses.  Damage
from these claws will affect creatures that can only be hit by +3 or
less magic weapons.  But, the claws are not magical.  Note that the
claws does not affect the cleric's spell casting ability or his
capability to hold or manipulate objects.  To cast this spell, the
cleric needs a sprig of mistletoe and a claw from a lion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oxen Strength (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Through the use of oxen strength, the cleric is able to endow himself
or herself with the strength of an ox. The result is that the cleric's
strength is raised 1 point for every level that he has attained, to a
maximum of 18.  The component for this spell is mistletoe and a strip
of beef jerky made from an ox that was sacrificed during one of the
clerical rites.

Protection from Constriction (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: 3"
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast, a Protection from Constriction spell will mitigate crushing
damage taken each round from a single attack form.  Up to one point per
level of the spell caster is deducted from crushing damage.  Note that
this does not mitigate damage from crushing weapons or falling; it will
protect against constriction, bear hugs, Bigby's Crushing Hand, or any
similar gradual compression.  Example: a sixth level cleric under the
effect of this spell is hugged by an owlbear on three consecutive
rounds for 3, 10, and 7 points of damage.  Damage accrued over each
round would be zero, 4, and 1 point(s), respectively.  The material
component is a hard-boiled egg anywhere on the spell recipient.

Remove Scar (Necromancy) Reversible
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The purpose of this spell is to remove scars caused by battle or other
mishaps. Any comeliness that was lost due to scarring is now restored
from application of this spell. Larger scars may require several
applications to remove all the effects of the disfigurement.

The reverse of this spell causes hideous scars to form on the targets
face and body causing a loss of 1-3 comeliness points. Multiple
applications of this spell cannot drop comeliness lower than 0. A save
vs. spells will negate the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Root (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 3 creatures maximum
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the cleric causes a willing recipient's feet,
paws or hooves to be firmly rooted to the ground, becoming immovable.
The creature gains an extra saving throw vs. paralysation at +4 to
avoid being thrown back, picked up, knocked down or blown around.
Success means the creature remains standing; failure indicates the
situation is to be handled normally, with another saving throw if
allowed. The recipient may "root" and "unroot" at will, as long as it
occurs within the duration of the spell. Rooting or unrooting takes 1
segment. The recipient may not perform any action requiring legwork
(walking, running, etc.) while rooted. At he end of the spell's
duration, the recipient is automatically unrooted.

Optionally, the spell may be cast upon an unwilling subject (who must
be touched by the caster and fail a save vs. spells at -2 to be
affected). Unlike the caster, the victim has no control over the spell
once touched and is anchored until released by the cleric, the root
duration expires or it is dispelled. The material components for this
spell are mistletoe and a small piece of root from a large tree,
preferably oak.

Root is one of the special prayers granted by Saint Timorel, patron of
clerical groves and retreats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selective Entangle (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 8"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One person per 2 levels
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is very similar to the first level clerical spell Entangle
except for one major difference. It effects only the creatures targeted
for the spell effects and no-one else, unlike the entangle spell.

When the creature(s), who are effected by this spell, try to walk by
any form of plant life, the plants will reach out and grab the
creatures much in the same manner as the Entangle spell. Thus if they
are trapped by the spell others can then walk up to the entangled
creatures. In this respect the spell is similar to Hold Person in its
effects.

If the creature fails its saving throw vs. spells then it is held fast
by the plants. If the save is made then the targeted creature has its
movement reduced to half normal.

If the creature struggles to free themselves from the plants then a new
saving throw vs. spells can be made every turn (note: this is very
tiring work). The strength to hit bonus can be used as a positive DM on
these additional saves. If the creature makes one of these additional
saving throws then they are "freed" but their movement is still reduced
by half. If after another turn the creature is still in an area with
plant life then a save vs. spells is required with the effects outlined
above occurring.

In short, a save must be made every turn when in areas of vegetation to
determine the effects of the spell if the spell target is actively
fighting the effects of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stone Seeds (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 month
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 5" long square per level
Saving Throw: None

When the stone seed spell is cast, it causes plant seeds to become
magically enchanted so as to enable them to grow in to solid stone.
The seeds will grow at quadruple normal rate for 4 weeks. During this
time the roots will grow down into the stone a distance of 1" per level
of the caster in hard stone or 2" per level in soft stone. After this
month (28 days) is over, the plants will grow normally. Thus they will
require food, light, and sunlight if they are to continue growing after
this point.

The effect of the plants growing into a stone structure are rather
nasty, for it could remove around 10-90% of the structure's structural
points, depending upon the thickness of the stone.

To cast this spell, the cleric must mix a handful of seeds from
whatever hardy plants are available (such as crabgrass, ivy, cactus,
dandelion etc.) with the seeds to be planted. This must be then mixed
in a leather pouch with sapphire dust of not less than 50 GP value per
5" square area to be covered. The caster then "sows" the seeds as he
casts the spell with the seeds magically implanting themselves in the
stone.

The spell takes 1 turn per 5" square area to be covered to cast.
