Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell exactly duplicates the effects of a Necklace of Adaptation

Awake (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the cleric invokes the blessings of his deity
and claps his hands sharply once.  The sound of the clap allows all
creatures within the area of effect who hears it to awaken.  Sleeping
(naturally or magically induced) creatures will wake up.  Those under
the influence of mind affecting drugs/substances will become coherent
for 1 round per level of the caster.  Creatures who's minds are under
some sort of foreign influence (i.e. charmed, hypnotised, dominated,
enthralled, etc. but not possessed) get a second saving throw.  In any
case, all creatures within the effect will experience a temporary
clarity of thought.  Note, this may make the subject more vulnerable to
any mind based earsdropping such as ESP or empathy.  The material
component for this spell is a 1,000 GP gem hanging on a chain which
must be wound around the cleric's hand while he claps.

Beppie's Happy Hour (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 100-foot radius area
Saving Throw: Special

Casting this spell can have quite unpredictable effects, i.e. no one
can predict what will happen after the spell's duration has expired.
When cast, all creatures within 100 feet of the caster are immediately
overcome by an enormous feeling of joy and an unresistible desire to
party. No saving throw is applicable.

For exactly one hour, everyone within the area of effect will party:
they will drink, sing, dance, and otherwise rejoice. Also, all within
the area of effect will feel no feelings of hatred, fear, or other
"negative" feelings. All others will be considered friends, for the
time being.

Anyone entering the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spells
to avoid being affected. This roll is repeated every round. Those
leaving the area of effect will remain under the spell's effect, but
upon noticing that they are leaving the fun place, they will probably
try to return to the party, since they're really in the mood.

Note that the area of effect moves with the caster, that the caster
himself is always affected by the spell, and that those affected by the
spell will probably have run out of alcohol at the end of the spell's
duration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy) Reversible
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of cure medium wounds. The spell
cures (or causes) 9-37 (4d8+5) hit points per application. Otherwise
this spell is the same in all respects as a Cure Light Wounds spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Curse (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: None

When cast, a detect curse spell enables the cleric to detect the
existence of a curse on the creature or object, such as a cursed
sword.  The spell will detect the first cursed creature or object that
lies along the casting cleric's line of sight (and within range) with a
base chance of 50%.  An extra 1% is added to the base chance for each
level of experience of the casting cleric.  Note that stone of more
than 1' thickness or metal of any thickness will block the spell.  The
material components of the spell are the cleric's holy or unholy symbol
and a crushed sapphire of at least 1000 GP value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Specialisation (Alteration, Invocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster's weapon
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the second level cleric spell Specialisation
except for two differences. The first is that it gives the cleric
double specialisation in the god's preferred weapon, if he has one, or
the clerics weapon of choice if not. The second difference is that this
spell can be used to give specialisation to another person in any
chosen weapon.

The material and somatic gestures are the same as for specialisation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fearlessness (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: All followers in a 6" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it fills the followers of the caster's god
with bravery. For the duration of the spell, all of the followers will
be immune to any form of fear.

There is one additional material component required. The spell requires
the ritual slaying of a "brave" animal such as a lion. The cleric then
drinks the blood of the animal and then "blesses" the followers, thus
transferring the trait of bravery to them.

That material component causes some druids to be upset, so that there
is sometimes friction between the religion that uses this spell and the
local sect of druids.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fish Command (Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One fish
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any fish within range as long
as the fish can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal fishes
can be affected, including variants in size. Thus catfish, sharks etc.
can be commanded but dolphins (mammals) or mermaids cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
fish will automatically understand the language the caster is speaking.
Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they cannot be
commanded by this spell. The material component of this spell is a
fish's fin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hallucinatory Plain (Illusion/Phantasm) Reversible
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 8"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 4" long square per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the hallucinatory forest spell (q.v.) save
that the caster causes an area to appear as if it is a relatively flat
plain or clearing.

The greatest uses for this spell would be to hide a forest to protect
or trap others. Other uses would be to hide a chasm, mine, or to extend
a cliff...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meandering Path (Alteration, Illusion)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 1 mile + 1/2 mile per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 10 feet at both sides of path travelled
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the cleric causes a path (which appears to be natural,
old, man-made, etc) to appear.  Any who come across this path will
believe it to be what it appears.  To cast the spell, the cleric needs
two branches from an oak tree.  One is planted at the beginning of the
path.  The cleric then walks the route that he wishes the magical path
to follow.  At the end of the path the other branch is planted and the
spell is cast. Travel upon the path is either easy or hard (depending
on the cleric's choice of travel).  Those who happen on the path must
make a saving throw.  Average the hit dice or levels of the group and
roll one saving throw (DM does this without the group's knowledge).  If
they fail, the path then appears to be heading in the direction that
they wish to travel.  If the save is made, the path appears as it is
(i.e. a path in the direction that the cleric walked) and the group may
still decide to follow it anyway.

While travelling on this path, the group will never surprise anyone or
anything and suffers a penalty of on all rolls (saves, to hit, damage,
Dex checks, etc.).  Those trying to leave the path after travelling
upon it find that the path is bordered by heavy thorns that block
passage and writhe and grasp all who enter (cf. Wall of Thorns &
Entangle).  This wall attacks as the cleric doing 1d6+2 points of
damage.  Each 10' section of thorns has 3 attacks.  The wall arches
over the path to prevent exit by flying, leaping, etc.  The spell also
counters the ability of Pass without Trace of other clerics.

Fire results in a double strength Wall of Fire in that area (but it
does not create a passable space, i.e.  take fire damage and still be
attacked by thorns).  The only way to leave the path is to follow it to
its end (or teleport, go ethereal, plane shift).  A Dispel Magic is
possible only on the oak branches at the end of the path (either one).

Moonlight (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Sun
Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 10,000 contiguous square feet or yards (see below)
Saving Throw: None

A Moonlight spell produces, in the area of effect, ambient light equal
to that of a full moon regardless of cloud or tree cover, although
objects below tree cover or ceilings will cast normal shadows.
Underground, the area of effect is in square feet, outdoors, in square
yards.  The material component is a 50 GP moonstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neutralise Gas (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1' per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell will detoxify any poisonous gas. Any poisonous gas within
the area of effect will be turned into a fine watery mist and be
completely harmless. Even Green Dragon breath will be rendered harmless
by this spell.

If the spell is cast upon an object or creature, then the sphere will
move with the target. A target creature would get a save vs. spells to
avoid this effect if they are unwilling. If the target saves then the
globe will center in the nearby area. Use the thrown missiles table to
determine where the spell actually centers. This may mean that the
target is still in the area of effect until it moves.

The reverse of this spell, Poison Gas, will create a cloud of poisonous
gas which will slay outright any creatures in the area of effect that
are under 2+1 Hit Dice. All other creatures must make a save vs. poison
at -2 every round that they stay in the cloud or die in 1-3 rounds. If
the creatures make their save for that round, then they only take 3-18
damage instead. If the target creature has the spell centered around
itself, and then has a slow poison cast, then the target only takes 1
point of damage per round.

Regardless of what version of the spell is cast, the caster holy symbol
and a sprig of belladonna is required to cast the spell. The belladonna
disappears after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pacify (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Charm
Range: 12"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: All creatures in a 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the cleric dispels feelings of anger and fear
from the target creatures.  Note that this does not produce any
feelings of goodwill in the subjects: a creature engaged in
premeditated homicide would be unaffected.  The duration is permanent
until the creatures in concern are again given cause to be angry or
afraid.  Note: magic resistance does not affect this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possess Animal (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 100" + 10" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: One natural creature
Saving Throw: Negates

By use of this spell, the cleric is able to project his spirit into
that of an animal, forcing the creature to behave according to his
will.  The creature must be a normal creature and have fewer hit dice
than the cleric.  The animal is allowed a saving throw versus spell and
if successful the spell has no effect.  Once the animal is possessed,
the cleric can cause it to do anything within its ability, regardless
of the consequences to the animal.  However, for every point of damage
suffered by the animal, the cleric suffers 1/2 a point of damage.  In
addition, should the animal die while under the control of the
shukenja, a system shock roll must be made.  If the roll is failed, the
cleric also dies.  While controlling the animal, the cleric's body
enters a catatonic state.  If the body is disturbed or moved, the spell
is disrupted.  The material component for this spell is a holly leaf
and some hair from the animal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2 per creature touched
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: None

All creatures affected by this spell are bestowed with the equivalent
of a +1 Ring of Protection (+1 on armour class and saving throws).  This
is not cumulative with bonuses given by rings or cloaks of protection.
Each creature may be touched only once, i.e., the protection is not
stackable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection From Elementals, 10' radius (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equal to the fourth level priest spell Protection from
Evil, 10' radius, except as noted above, and that it protects only from
elementals. The material component for this spell is some substance of
elementary sort (e.g., a handful of sand, some water, or even just
blowing into the air). For every element supplied while casting, the
appropriate elementals will be scared away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove Scars (Necromancy) Reversible
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person
Saving throw: Special

On casting this spell, the cleric is empowered to remove scars or other
similar marks (burn marks, birth marks, etc.).  This will enable the
recipient of the spell to restore lost charisma caused by such marks.
Note that this spell will not affect charisma lowered by other means
(e.g. magical).  Charisma can be restored by up to 1/2 point per level
of the caster, rounded up (4 points at 7th and 8th levels, 5 points at
9th and 10th levels, etc.).  Charisma cannot be restored above its
former value by means of this spell.

Multiple applications will only succeed if the recipient makes a saving
throw against spells for each application after the first.  If the
saving throw is unsuccessful, then no more points can be restored by
the use of this spell.  Future charisma loss can, however, be
restored.  The reverse of the spell is not permanent, but will reduce
charisma by 2-5 points for a duration of 1 turn per level of the
caster.  The target of a bestow scars spell must be touched.  If the
victim is touched, a successful saving throw versus spells is necessary
in order to negate the effects of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reptile Command (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One reptile
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any reptile within range as
long as the reptile can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only
normal reptiles can be affected, including variants in size. Thus
lizards, giant lizards etc.  can be commanded but dragons cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
reptile will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they
cannot be commanded by this spell.  The material component of this
spell is a reptile's tail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanctum Sigil (Abjuration, Invocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10" radius sphere centered on the sigil
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a magical symbol similar to that produced by a Glyph
of Warding.  It is inscribed in the air, does not move, and provides
protection from either law, chaos, good, or evil, in the following
manner: should any creature of the specified alignment enter the area
of effect, the cleric will be mentally alerted to its presence, even
awakened from sleep, provided that the cleric is himself within the
area of effect.  Note that the warning message to the cleric gives
neither its alignment nor its location, and only the cleric receives
said message.  The material component is burning incense.
