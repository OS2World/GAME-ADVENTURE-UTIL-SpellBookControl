Avian Command (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Animal, Charm
Range: 90-yard radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: One avian
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to command any avian within range as long
as the avian can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal
avians can be affected, including variants in size. Thus eagles,
sparrows, doves etc. can be commanded but pegasi and phoenixes cannot.
The command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
avian will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Since familiars are not considered to be normal animals, they
cannot be commanded by this spell. The material component of this spell
is a feather.

Dariod's Vestigial Vine (Alteration)
Level: 5
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration 1 round per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell will allow the caster to grow forth from one of his fingers
a vine. While any finger from either of the caster's hands is usable,
the index finger of the caster's primary hand is generally chosen. The
vine, while a magical extension of the cleric's body, is treated as a
separate physical entity, therefore having an AC 5 and 30 hit points
(plus an additional 2 HP per level of the casting cleric).

The spell will end when either the maximum duration is reached or the
vine takes more damage than it has hit points. The vine moves in a
snaking fashion and is usable in most ways that an arm is. It uses up
one of the caster's actions to use the vestigial vine, so, if the
caster had only 1 attack per round and he chose to attack a creature
with the vine then he would be incapable of performing another action
until the following round.

The vine can attempt to retrieve an object, wield a sickle or similar
weapon (although at a penalty of -2 "to hit" due to the unwieldiness of
a man-made weapon in the vine's clutches), or it may be used to whip
opponents. Whipping is the primary form of attack of the vine and,
assuming a successful "to hit" roll (no adjustments), the target will
receive 1d10 points of damage.

The material component for the spell is a small strand of vine and the
juice from half a dozen holly berries (squeezed from said berries).

Entreaty (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 5
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 6" radius area
Saving Throw: None

This spell exactly duplicates the effect of a Chant spell, except that
the caster need not continue chanting.  Its effects are cumulative only
with a Chant spell, and not Bless, Prayer, or Protection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Godrage (Alteration, Enchantment)
Level: 5
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the cleric calls down the attention of his
divinity and invokes the righteous wrath of the deity.  As the earthly
consequence of this Godrage, the cleric goes berserk.  He will for the
duration of the spell, instinctively attack in melee combat any
unbelievers (creatures of a differing alignment) within a 6" radius,
giving preference to the most extreme alignments first.  The spell does
not give knowledge of specific alignments, only a feeling of who is the
most worthy of being punished.  Note use of this spell may result in
the cleric attacking his own party members.

While under the effects of the spell, the cleric attacks on the fighter
table and gains a temporary skill level with his weapons (note: in my
world, specialisation is more developed and certain clerics can
specialise to some degree, those who are not specialised, gain the
basic level of specialisation for the Duration of this spell).
Furthermore, the presence of the divinity surrounds the cleric in the
form of an aura that reduces all damage taken by the cleric by 2 points
(1 point minimum).  Godrage is a state not unlike the berserkergang,
but it differs in that while the cleric engages solely in physical
combat, he is still able to make intelligent decisions on how combat is
to be conducted.  After the spell ends, the cleric must rest 1 round
for every 2 rounds under the spells effect.  The components for this
spell is the cleric's body, a short verbal sermon given to the
unbelievers and a consecrated weapon.

Hidden Champion (Necromancy)
Level: 5
Source:  Great Net Prayerbook, V3
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One sentient creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Through the use of this spell, the cleric establishes a link between
his lifeforce and the subject creature's.  The effect of this link is
that one-half the damage sustained by one, is transferred to the
other.  This link is evidenced by a golden, pulsing thread connecting
the two through the ethereal plane.  When the link is in existence, the
two creatures cannot be more than 1 mile per level of the spell caster
apart or the link will snap, ending the spell.  Those able to perceive
the ethereal plane can see this link.  Note that the damage transfer is
two way.  A duly consecrated alter, holy or unholy water, an
appropriate sacrifice (DM's discretion) and the creature to be linked
with are the material components for this spell.

Side note: I used this for an evil cleric the party was trying to
kill.  The cleric kidnapped the betrothed of the paladin and performed
this ceremony upon her.  This really messed up the party since, now
they couldn't just rush in and hack up the cleric in an orgasm of
hack-n-slash.  They had to capture the cleric and remove him from his
sanctuary alive. (I run consecrated grounds as being "home field" for
clerics and very disadvantageous for would be desecrators. Example: -1
penalty on everything per alignment difference, cumulative bless for
the clerics and generally "bad luck" for the attackers)

With each casting of this spell, the cleric raises his effective level
by one, to a maximum of two additional levels of effectiveness.  The
increase applies to all clerical actions: spell effects, turning
undead, saving throws, hit probability, etc.  Not affected by this
spell are hit points, number of spells known and level of spells
known.

grants the victim no saving throw, but has an important prerequisite:
the victim of the spell must be in love with the caster. This love must
be non-magical in nature. Furthermore, the victim may not be under the
influence of any spell from the Enchantment/Charm school.

This spell may only be cats by a good-aligned priest if he himself is
also im love with the victim, and commits suicide immediately after the
casting.

The material component for this spell are the caster's holy symbol and

mammals can be affected, including variants in size. Thus polar bears,
whales, etc. can be commanded but sphinxes and xorns cannot.  The
command must be given in a short sentence of at most 25 words.  The
mammal will automatically understand the language the caster is
speaking. Note that for this purpose, humans, demihumans and humanoids
are not considered mammals.  Since familiars are not considered to be
normal animals, they cannot be commanded by this spell. The material
component of this spell is a nail of a mammal.

Ostracise (Charm)

Upon casting this spell, the victim is effectively ostracised form his
community: everyone knowing the victim will look upon him with
disregard, or even disgust. Even good friends and close relatives will
start neglecting and avoiding the character, eventually resulting in
total isolation of the victim.

This spell only affects reactions of those that knew the character
before the spell was cast: the victim can, for example, more to another
town and start a "new life" there. People meeting him there will react
normally, unless the outcast's reputation has somehow reached them, in
which case the may act prejudiced.

This spell can be remove by a Remove Curse spell, provided it is cast
by someone of at least two levels higher than the caster of Ostracise.
Also, a Limited Wish or Wish will remove the effects.

To cast this spell, the priest must point at the victim and order him
to leave the community, informing him that his presence there is no
longer appreciated. The victim must be able to understand the words of
the caster. The victim receives a saving throw vs. spells, modified for
wisdom, with a -1 penalty to the die roll for every three levels of
experience he has less than the caster. If the victim is of higher
level, he receives a +1 bonus for every level of difference.
