Alpha's Comet (Conjuration, Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a flaming missile with a trail of superheated
noxious gasses.  The comet unerringly strikes one target, the impact
causing 3d6 damage and the flames an additional 3d6.  Furthermore, any
creature within 5' of the comet's path will suffer 2d4 fire damage.
All those within 5' of the point of impact will suffer 3d4.  Anyone who
suffers damage from this spell is also considered to have been engulfed
in the noxious fumes, and will be at -2 on all rolls (10% spell failure
chance) for 1-6 rounds due to coughing, choking, and blurred vision.
The material component is a ball of pitch mixed with sulfur and
phosphorus.

Alpha's Darklight (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as the second level magic-user spell
darkness 15' radius (q.v.), except in that the caster can see normally
through the darkness so created as if in normal lighting conditions.
Alternatively, the caster can bestow the visual benefits to another
character by crushing the material component and sprinkling the dust
into the eyes of the recipient.  The material component is a piece of
coal or charcoal, which must be crushed and applied as above.  Note
that the spell only allows normal vision through the darkness caused by
the particular casting, and lends no benefit towards other darkness,
either normal or magical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Flames of the Faltine (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell sheathes the caster in hot yellow flames and blurs the
caster's features somewhat, causing them to assume a smooth and
somewhat indistinct shape, also turning a dark red colour.  The flames
will appear to be present even coming out of the caster's eyes and
mouth.  These flames give the caster no special protection, but they do
shed bright light in a 30' radius.  Furthermore, any creature striking
the caster with a claw, bite, or similar attack or a hand-held weapon
less than 5 feet long will suffer damage as though contacting a Wall of
Fire spell (q.v.) - 2d6 damage + 1 point per level of the caster.
Undead suffer double damage, and creatures especially susceptible to
flame may also take additional damage.  The caster may attempt a melee
attack to burn others with this fire, a successful blow causing 1d6
damage + 1 point per two levels of the caster.  Creatures passing
within a 5' radius of the caster suffer 1d4 heat damage.  By standing
still and concentrating, the caster may extend this heat radiation,
inflicting 2d4 within a 5' radius and 1d4 within a 10' radius, but this
falls back to the usual level if the caster stops concentrating or
resumes moving.  The caster can attempt to destroy inanimate objects by
touching them, requiring a save vs. normal fire to avoid destruction.
This may be attempted once per round, at a -1 cumulative penalty for
each consecutive round of handling.  Items on the caster's person at
the time of the casting of this spell are unaffected by the flame.  The
caster may end this spell prematurely if desired.  The material
component for this spell is a flask of oil, poured over the caster's
head during the casting of the spell, and an open flame of any size.

Alpha's Heat Lightning (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls down a bolt of reddish-purple lightning which strikes
a single creature within range.  The bolt inflicts 1d6 of damage per
level of the caster.  Cold or water-based creatures suffer an
additional 1 point of damage per die, while creatures resistant to heat
OR electricity suffer 1/2 normal damage (1/4 with a successful save).
All non-magical metal worn by the target must save vs. lightning (at +2
if the save was made, but at -2 if the save was failed) or be fused to
any nearby metal (sword fused to gauntlet, pieces of armour fused
together, preventing movement).  The material component of this spell
is a short glass rod, a bit of fur, and a bit of iron or lodestone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Ice Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the magic-user opens a small hole in the spatial
fabric into the supernatural cold of the para-elemental plane of ice.
It brings forth a shaft of solid para-elemental ice 6 inches thick and
10 feet long (the hole is opened for only a very brief time).  This
missile hits with great force, causing 3-30 points of damage from the
impact alone.  If the target saves vs. petrification, only a glancing
blow is dealt, and the victim suffers only 1-10 points of damage.

An additional save (also vs. petrification, and at +4 if only a
glancing blow was suffered) must be made, or the victim will be stunned
for 1-6 rounds from the force of the blow.

The ice absorbs heat from the nearby air, and this causes 1-6 points of
cold damage (no saving throw) to all within 5 feet of the bolt's path,
and within a 10' radius of the target creature.  The bolt shatters upon
striking its target, and the victim will suffer an additional 4-24
points of cold damage (2-12 if only a glancing blow was suffered).

Fire-using creatures take double damage from the cold caused by the
bolt, while those resistant to cold take none.  Both types of creatures
suffer full damage from the bolt itself.

Water-based creatures in liquid form will suffer only 1-10 points of
damage from the blow, and cannot be stunned, but they will
automatically be slowed for 2-8 melee rounds.

If the target creature is struck fully (i.e. fails the initial saving
throw), then exposed items on that side of the caster must make a save
vs.  crushing blow, and all items carried by the caster must save vs.
magical frost (note also that items on the side struck by the bolt must
save at -10, due to the cold and the blow).

The material component of this spell is a clear gem worth not less than
100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Images of Ikonn (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Mirror Image spell (q.v.).  The
caster gains 1 mirror image for each level of experience, rather than
rolling randomly.  These images can appear anywhere within 15' of the
caster, and a blurring distortion effect occurs in the casting of this
spell and at the end of each melee round which prevents isolation of
the true wizard in the new melee round, even if the wizard was
successfully attacked in the previous round.  Area effect attacks
(Fireball, etc.) can still affect the caster even if his location is
not known.  As a final benefit, if one of the images is struck by an
opponent, the caster may make an unmodified save vs. breath weapon.  If
successful, the image will not be dispelled by the blow.  The material
component of this spell is a small carving or doll of the caster and a
broken mirror.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Lightwall (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10' per level long square
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into
being at any point within the range of the caster.  Vision through the
wall by any means is quite impossible, though it is negated by a
darkness (q.v.) spell cast at it.  When the wall first comes into
being, all those within 10 feet of it who are not averting their eyes
(thus a mage could warn his companions that he was about to cast this
spell) must make a save vs. petrification to avert their gaze from the
wall in time to avoid being dazzled by its brightness.  This dazzling
results in a -2 penalty to hit, a 20% spell failure chance for spell
casters, and a -1 penalty on initiative dice rolls.  These effects
persist for as many rounds as the difference between the victim's die
roll and the roll needed for him to save.  These effects can persist
even after the duration of the spell has elapsed.  Naturally, blind or
sightless creatures are unaffected by this spell, but subterranean or
dark dependent creatures (e.g. drow, duergar, svirfneblin) suffer a -3
on their saving throw.  Further, they are not protected by their normal
magic resistance, as the spell is not cast directly at them.  They are
as vulnerable to its existence as any other creature would be.  The
light given off is equivalent to a continual light (q.v.) spell within
20', and equivalent to a light spell (i.e. normal torchlight) in an
additional 80' radius.  The Lightwall, if cast out of doors, can be
seen up to a mile away per level of the caster (reflecting the
additional size of a larger caster's Lightwall).  The wall can, of
course, be created smaller than the maximum size for the caster's
level.  The wall itself causes no damage to creatures passing through
it.  However, a character fighting someone with a Lightwall directly
behind him suffers a -1 on his chances to hit (note that this is
cumulative with the dazzling effects described above).  Similarly to
the first level wall of darkness (q.v.) spell, sound is blocked by the
Lightwall, assuming that it does not allow sound waves to travel around
the sides of it (as when cast outdoors, for example).  It does not
absorb sound or prevent spellcasting, it merely does not allow sound to
pass through it (even if such sound is from a Horn of Blasting or a
Shout spell).  The material component is a clear gemstone or a sunstone
worth not less than 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Lucent Lance (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

There must be some ambient light available in order for this spell to
work.  The effectiveness of this spell is determined by the amount of
ambient light available.  The caster must concentrate for a full round
to focus the light into the Lucent Lance, after which its energy may be
released.  The power of the Lance is such that it can carve through
wood or soft metal up to 4 inches thick, stone up to 1 inch thick, or
hard metal up to .25 inch thick, this thickness multiplied by the
appropriate modifier on the table below.  Items carried by a living
creature are partially protected by that creature's aura, and gain a
save vs. magical fire (modified as below) to avoid being damaged by the
Lance.  Living creatures suffer a base of 1d6 damage, modified as
below, with a maximum upper limit of not more than 1d6 per level of the
caster.  The Lucent Lance coalesces as a ball of light around the
caster's hand holding the material component, and shoots forth until
maximum range is reached or until a sufficient thickness of material
blocks its progress.  The Lucent Lance may be traversed over an arc up
to 1' per level of the caster at its maximum range.  The caster's hand
glows brightly while the spell is being cast and while it is active.

 						Damage		Save
 Type of light					Modifier	Modifier
 ------------------------------------------	--------	--------
 Candlelight					x.5		+3
 Single torch or lantern			x 1		+1
 Multiple torches, Light spell, starlight,
 	magical dagger				x 2		+0
 Large bonfire, bright moonlight, Continual
 	Light spell, magical sword		x 4		-1
 Multiple magical light sources, indirect
 	or filtered sunlight			x 6		-2
 Direct sunlight, Sunray spell			x 12		-4 

If the light source used is a fire of some sort, that fire has a 50%
chance of going out.  A permanent light effect (e.g. magical sword or
dagger) will lose its power to shed light for 1d10 rounds.  A spell
used as the light source will be automatically dispelled if it's a
1st-3rd level spell, and will have its duration cut by 25% if a higher
level spell.  The material component is a small, oblong corundum rod
worth at least 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Night of the Leonids (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast outdoors at night.  It calls down a number
of flaming meteorites to strike unerringly any targets within range.
The caster can call down 1d4 meteorites, plus another for every five
levels of experience (d4+1 at 5th-9th, d4+2 at 10th-14th, etc.).  Each
meteorite strikes a single target, though more than one may strike any
given target.  Each of these "Leonids" comes blazing down from the
heavens, striking for d6+1 impact damage and an additional d6+1 fire
damage. The material component for this spell is a bit of meteoric
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Rolling Thunder (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: Special

The caster need but throw his arms heavenward and a great rolling
thunderclap will sound directly overhead. All creatures within 10' of
the caster must save vs. petrification or be knocked prone, suffering
1d4 + 1 damage, and are automatically stunned for 1 round and deafened
for 1d4 + 1 rounds. Those within one-half the radius of the spell (e.g.
within 25' of a 10th level caster) but not within 10' must save vs.
spells or be stunned for 1 round, and are automatically deafened for
1d4 + 1 rounds.  All others in the area of effect must save vs. spells
or be deafened for 1d4 + 1 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Silverlight (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Continual Light spell in that it
creates a very bright light (almost as bright as full daylight).
However, any creature within the area of light which is vulnerable to
silver (e.g. wights, wraithes, lycanthropes, devils) will suffer 1d6
damage every round that it remains in the area of effect, and will be
at -2 to on to hit rolls and +2 to be hit due to the intense discomfort
felt by such creatures while within the Silverlight. Alternatively, the
caster may throw the spell directly at a single target. Such a creature
must save vs. spells or be blinded for the duration of the spell. If
the save is made, the spell forms as per usual about one foot behind
the intended target, and its duration is halved. A creature vulnerable
to silver who is thus targeted need not save vs. blinding, but will
instead suffer d6+1 (2-7) points of damage per level of the caster, up
to a maximum of 10d6+10, and will be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A
successful saving throw vs. spells at -2 will halve the damage and
reduce the duration of the stun to a single round. If thrown thus at a
creature vulnerable to silver, the spell will not form normally,
regardless of the saving throw, as its magic is used up in the attack
on the creature. The material component is a bit of pure silver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Starfire (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' diameter column, 30' high
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a column of brilliant, blazing silvery-white
flames.  All within 10' of the column not looking away must save vs.
petrification or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled (-2 to hit, +2 to
be hit) for an additional 1d3 rounds.  Creatures adversely affected by
bright light (e.g drow, duergar) save at -3 vs. this effect.  Any
creature within the narrow column of fire (most likely only a single
creature) is automatically blinded and dazzled as above, and
additionally suffers 1d6 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 10d6.  A save vs. spells will halve this damage.  If the
spell is cast outdoors under a night sky, a bonus of +1 per die of
damage is added.  The material component for this spell is a bit of
silver and a shard of crystal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Astral Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1 yard per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level, 5-foot radius at first level
Saving Throw: None

This creates a wall (which can have any shape the caster desires,
including a sphere) which prevents physical effects which would pass
through normal walls, such as Teleport, Astral Projection, Monkish
"phase" ability, etc. Any such attempt by a character will fail,
leaving the character on the other side of the wall. It is, however,
possible to simply walk through an Astral Wall. If the spell is linked
to an existing physical wall (including one created by Wall of Stone or
Iron), the duration becomes one hour per level. The Astral Wall can be
disrupted by Dispel Magic cast from either the physical or astral
plane. The material component is a piece of parchment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azalldam's Waterspray (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 50' long, 5' to 15' wide cone
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell causes a high-pressured cone of water to stream from the
caster's hand; this cone is 50 feet long, 5 feet wide at the caster's
hand, and 15 feet wide at the base. The majority of damage is caused by
the high pressure of the stream; anyone caught inside the area of
effect suffers 3d8 points of damage; a successful saving throw vs.
spell will reduce this damage by one half. Those who fail their saves
must roll saves vs. crushing blow for all their possessions to avoid
their destruction. In addition, victims who fail their initial saves
must make a dexterity check; if this check fails, the target is pushed
backwards 1-20 yards, and is knocked prone.

The water from this spell will extinguish any normal fires, but has
only a 50% chance to put out magical fires. This spell will inflict
double damage on fire elementals or similar creatures.

The material component for this spell is a large beaker of water which
is used up when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brains (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 6 hours per level
Casting Time: 1 hour

The recipient of this spell gains a temporary increase in intelligence
as follows:

 Normal	Extra
 Int	Points
 ------	------
 1-4	4
 5-8	3
 9-11	2
 12-13	1

Note: this is not cumulative.

Burning Hands II (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10'
Components: V, S

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is exactly the same as its namesake except that it does
twice the amount of damage and reaches 10' out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Channel Item (Enchantment, Invocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One rechargeable magic item
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is used to recharge any item which was initially created by
the use of an Enchant an Item spell, such as magical rings, gems, rods,
staves, and wands; but not limited to such.

The wizard must be fully rested and not engaged in any physical
activity to cast this spell. Usually, most mages try to find a secure
area since the chance of spell failure can be deadly. He first cast
this spell over the item, in the process opening up a channel between
him and the magic item to be recharged, taking one round to initiate
the channel. At this time, the total possible charges an item may
contain may be discerned by casting an Identify at this time with a
modifier of +10% added onto his normal chance of success. Then, the
appropriate spells must be cast into the item to affect its
recharging. While the spells needed for various items are too large to
be listed, it can be assumed that a spell which the item imitates is
able to recharge the item. (Spell research can aid in gaining more
knowledge of this subject).

At the end of the recharging session (or at least before the channeling
effect ends due to the casting time limitations) the mage must "close"
the item's channel. This requires a successful saving throw vs. spells
modified by +1 for every level of the spellcaster and -1 for every
spell cast into the item which did nothing to recharge it. A failed
saving throw means that none of the spells cast into the item had any
recharging affect. If the mage is physically attacked and/or the spell
disrupted during the recharging period the mage must make an unmodified
successful saving throw vs. spells, with a successful save indicating
the entire process has been merely cast for naught and a failed save
indicating that the magic item explodes for a magical blast effect in a
10- to 60-foot radius doing damage equal to 1-4 HP of damage per charge
the item currently contains (save vs. spells for half damage). The item
in question (unless of artifact or relic status) is irrevocably ruined
in the explosion. The material component of this spell is a small gold
funnel worth at least 100 GP value, which is destroyed in the casting
of the spell.

The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charm Undead (Enchantment/Charm, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One or more creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell works just like the Players' Handbook spell Charm Monster,
except as noted above and that it only works on undead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conceal Magic (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 hours per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: Negates

Cast it on a magic item and it renders that item undetectable by Detect
Magic (great for hiding magical traps). The caster will not know if the
object has made its saving throw, though he can of course check this by
casting a Detect Magic...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Curse Weapon (Enchantment)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One weapon
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is used to curse the weapon of an opponent. When it is cast,
the caster chooses which weapon to curse. Unless the owner of the
weapon makes a successful save vs. spell, that weapon will have a
penalty applied to all "to hit" and damage rolls for the duration of
this spell. The penalty is equal to 1 for every four levels of the
caster, to a maximum of -5. This penalty only applies to the chosen
weapon, not to other weapons carried by the owner.

This spell will negate magical bonuses (only for the spell's duration);
if a weapon's magical bonus is reduced, its current value is used for
determining which types of creatures may be hit by it (i.e. if a +4
sword is reduced to +1 by this spell, it may not be used to hit
elementals for the duration of the spell).

The material component of this spell is a small replica of the weapon
to be cursed; it is consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Charm (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature per round
Saving Throw: None

This spell will reveal whether or not a recipient is under the effect
of a charm spell, provided that the recipient fails his saving throw.
Up to ten persons can be checked before the spell wanes. The caster has
a 5% chance per level of determining the exact nature of the charm
spell (or spells) which affect the recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Teleport (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 24" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Aftering casting this spell the caster gets an impression whenever
anyone arrives via teleport, enters or leaves the prime material plane
in the area of effect. The spell lasts only while the caster
concentrates on it. The impression will not reveal the location within
the range in which the effect occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dreamoore's Eldritch Sphere (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2" + 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1' diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This potent spell launches a mentally guided 1' diameter globe which
travels 0' - 60' per segment and turns up to 90 degrees per round. The
sphere strikes as a monster of the caster's hit dice, but even on a
missed roll, the missile may return the following round as long as the
magic-user concentrates. Once it hits, the globe disperses and inflicts
2d6 base damage + 2 damage points per level of its caster to the first
creature touched, up to 2d6 + 20 maximum potential (e.g. an 8 hit die
eldritch sphere inflicts 22-32 damage points).

The sphere harmlessly vanishes if the caster's concentration is broken
or the globe exceeds maximum range. Despite its limited area of effect,
the eldritch's sphere's true advantage is its damage potential and
ability to pursue and possibly corner single foes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eldarr's Spell Conversion (Alteration) Level 3
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows its caster to convert one spell into another of the
caster's choice. As long as the Spell Conversion is in effect, when
another spell is cast, the wizard may choose to cast it normally, or
alter it into another spell. The spell to be altered must be of 3rd
level or lower, and the spell to be converted to, must be of 2nd level
or lower (the addition level of power is expended in the conversion
process) and must be a spell the wizard already knows, although it does
not have to be currently memorised.

This spell is usually cast at the beginning of a day or before a known
encounter, to give the caster ample time to replace it in his memory
with another spell. Only wizard spells may be converted by this spell -
priestly spells are not affected by it, and only the caster's own
spells are affected.  Range, duration, area of effect, and saving
throws are as per the spell being converted to; the spell being
converted determines the spell components and casting time (however, in
order to convert a spell, a few additional incantations are necessary,
and the name of the new spell must also be uttered; this affectively
increases the casting time of the original spell by one).

As an example of the use of this spell, let us assume Biff the wizard
has cast this spell before a large battle; during the fight, Biff finds
himself levitated by an enemy spellcaster and dropped from a great
height. Unfortunately, Biff has nearly used up his compliment of spells
in the battle, and has a single Fireball left - not much use in this
situation. However, since the Spell Conversion is in effect, Biff
starts the incantations of the Fireball anyway; when he is dropped,
Biff casts the Fireball but uses the Spell Conversion to convert it to
a Feather Fall, and he floats softly to the ground unharmed.

The material component for this spell is the pelt of any were-creature;
the pelt is consumed with the casting.

Enhance Illusion (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One illusion
Saving Throw: None

This spell is one way for wizards to add actual substance to their
illusions. Up to two rounds before casting an illusion (notably
Phantasmal Force, Improved Phantasmal Force or Spectral Force), the
wizard casts this spell on the area in which the illusion is to
initially appear. Once cast, the illusion then does 10% of the actual
damage that it would do if it were real if the victim made a saving
throw against it, and is treated as normal with respect to armour
class, attacks, etc., if the victim failed the saving throw and doesn't
recognise it as an illusion. The illusion also becomes armour class
10, and gains 10% of the hit points it would normally have; however,
illusionary creatures may never have more combined hit dice than the
caster.

If the illusion is not cast in the enhanced area within 2 rounds the
former spell will be wasted. Multiple enhance illusions on one
illusion will cancel each other. This spell can also be used in
conjunction with shadow monsters, demi-shadow monsters or shades,
adding 10% more realism to that already inherent in the spell, and
lowering the perceived armour class by 1.

Enhance illusion is attributed to the deceased mage Scaurlin Oberlin,
who died in a magical duel with a grey slaad he summoned and
subsequently released. This is reputedly the only spell Scaurlin ever
wrote in his once-promising career.

Exploding Coins (Enchantment)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One coin per level (10 maximum)
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to enchant one or more coins with an
explosive charge; the more valuable the coin, the more potent the
explosion (see table below). The coins will retain their enchantment
until used or dispelled; the the explosion will be triggered when the
caster utters a command word chosen during the incantation.
Alternately, the caster may choose a delay, after which time the coin
will explode; the length of this delay may be up to 1 turn per level of
the caster (measured from the time the caster speaks the chosen command
word).

The following table gives the amount of damage for each type of coin,
along with the burst radius, and what level is required to enchant a
particular type of coin:

 		burst
 type		damage	level	radius
 ----		------	-----	-------
 copper		1d3	5	2 feet
 silver		1d4	8	2 feet
 electrum	1d6	11	5 feet
 gold		1d8	14	5 feet
 platinum	1d10	16	10 feet

A maximum of 10 coins may be enchanted per casting of this spell; also,
no more than 20 of these coins may be brought within 30 feet of each
other safely; if this occurs, the owner(s) must make a saving throw vs.
spell for *each* coin. If a coin fails its throw, it explodes normally;
if the throw succeeds, the coin simply vanishes in a puff of smoke.
This spell has the additional limitation that it may only be cast once
per two day period.

The only material component for this spell is the coin to be enchanted;
the coins are consumed in the explosion.

Fellstar's Flaming Vortex (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 8' high x 2' wide inverted cone
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls into being a spinning vortex of flames that resembles
a burning dust devil; the vortex is 8' high and 2' wide at its widest.
The caster may direct the movement of the vortex in any direction
desired, but it may not be moved across a body of water. The vortex
moves at a rate of 10' per round, and the caster must maintain full
concentration in order to direct its movements; if the caster loses
concentration, the vortex will move in a straight line at full movement
rate until the caster can again gain concentration. The wizard may not
move the vortex further away than 10 yards per level of the caster, or
the spell terminates.

The caster may use the vortex to attack a single victim per round; he
may attack the same target in following rounds, or may elect to move
the vortex to attack a different one. Anyone struck by the vortex
suffers 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum
of 10d4). A successful save vs. spell reduces this damage by half. The
flames from this spell will ignite flammable materials on contact, but
will not harm most other materials, unless exposure is prolonged. That
is, if a creature is attacked by the vortex for only a single round,
non-flammable possessions are not affected; if attacked on two
consecutive rounds, all possessions must save vs. magical fire normally
(but only if the target fails his save). Each additional round of
exposure inflicts a -1 on all possessions' saves (no penalty in added
to the target's save).

The material component for this spell is a piece of flammable material
suspended from a string; the caster lights the material on fire and
twirls it in a circle while casting the spell. He must continue doing
this throughout the duration of the spell, and the material must remain
lit; if it does not, the spell ends prematurely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Free Action (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the recipient the benefits of Protection from
Paralysis, and the additional benefits of being able to function
without penalty in a constricting environment (such as water, Web
spells, Entangle spells, etc). It does not affect paralysis already
existing, unless it is cast specifically to counter such in which case
it gives no further benefit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaseous Form (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d6 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to turn the creature touched into a pink
cloud of gas, for the duration of the spell. If the creature touched is
an unwilling recipient of the spell, he gets a save, with a successful
save negating the spell.

The spells effects are identical to that of the Potion of gaseous form,
with regards to movement rates, and the effects of a Gust of Wind
spell, though the caster, if he casts the spell on himself, can turn
non-gaseous at any time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grasping Hands of Horror (Necromancy)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One arm per level
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes a number of arms equal to the level of the caster to
reach out of the ground and grab at the target. The hands themselves do
no damage, but when they pull you under you start to suffocate.
Victims have to make a saving throw every round they are in the area of
effect and for every extra hand they have a -1 on their save.

In a graveyard or similar corpse-infested area there is an additional
-2. If they fail their save, they are dragged underground and start to
suffocate. Others can dig the victim out, mundanely or magically. He
will be found simply two feet or so under the ground, paralysed, but
quite aware of what happened. A really high-level mage could cast this
spell and affect many people by giving five arms to this target, four
to that one, and so on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hang (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, see below
Duration: 3 days
Casting time: Special
Area Of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the next spell the caster casts will be held (will not
take effect) until either the duration ends or the caster says a
keyword that will set off the spell.  The Spell that is held must be
third level or lower, and a magic user can only have one spell hung at
any given time.  For those spells that require a direction or a special
action (like pointing a finger for lightning bolt), the caster will
have to say the keyword and point at that time.  It takes one segment
for the held spell to go off (no casting time, only initiative), and
the caster should be given a bonus of +2 (in d6 initiative system) or
-4 (in the 10 segment system).  When the keyword is spoken by the
caster, it is only letting go of stored energy.  The caster still has
80% of his activity left in the round:  the caster can make one attack
or cast one first or second level spell late in the round.

The spell to be held must be cast with extreme caution.  It will take
twice the casting time and twice the components it would normally take
to cast that spell.  If the caster tries to cast another spell while
another spell is hung, the hung spell will fizzle.

No material components are needed to cast the spell hang, but those
needed to cast the next spell after are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold Spirit (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One to 4 spirits in a 20' cube
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell paralyses creatures which do not come from the plane they
are on, including conjured spirits and spirits possessing another
creature. If the spell is cast at 3 or 4 spirits, each gets an
unmodified saving throw. If two are being enspelled, they save at -1.
If there is a single target, it saves at -3. Held beings remain aware
of events around them and can use abilities which do not require motion
or speech. The material component for this is a straight piece of cold
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Improved Armour (Conjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the first level spell Armour although it
provides its wearer an armour class of AC 2. The Armour lasts until
dispelled or until it has received 16 + 2 points per level of the
caster worth of damage.

Note: The armour does not absorb damage nor is it ordinarily visible.
It will work with a shield (fighter/mages only), DEX bonuses, and other
magical protection devices, like rings and cloaks of protection,
although it will not protect a creature wearing artificial armour.
Artificial armour includes all manufactured armours, but does not
include skin or hides that are a natural part of the creature to be
protected.

The material component is a small piece of finely cured blessed leather
which the caster must rub all over his body while casting. Note: the
leather is reusable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jam Radio (Alteration, Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell prevents all magical communication spells of first or second
level from crossing the boundary of its area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamye's Prismatic Snowball (Alteration, Conjuration, Enchantment)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One snowball + 1 snowball per 3 levels
Saving Throw: Special

When cast, this spell creates a pile of coloured snowballs at the
caster's feet.  The number of snowballs is equal to the duration of the
spell in rounds - 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 6th level, 4 at 9th level, etc.
The caster can throw one snowball per round as if he were proficient in
snowball throwing.  Other characters can also throw snowballs, but they
will suffer a non-proficiency penalty for it (unless they have taken a
proficiency in snowballs).  The snowball has a range of 30 yards, plus
10 yards per Strength point of the thrower over 12.

The snowballs do no physical damage when they hit; however, they have
powers that vary with the colour of the snowball according to the chart
below.  In order for the snowball's magic to work, the target must be
hit with it (a successful "to hit" roll required).  The snowball's
power only affects the creature hit, even if the spell it duplicates
has a greater area of effect.  The snowballs are always picked up and
thrown in the order given, starting with red and ending (assuming the
spellcaster is high enough level) with violet.

 Number	Colour	Save vs.	Effect
 ------	------	------------	---------------------------------------
 1	Red	Spell		Charm Person
 2	Orange	Spell		Faerie Fire
 3	Yellow	Poison		Taunt *
 4	Green	Paralysation	Spook
 5	Blue	Paralysation	Glitterdust
 6	Indigo	Spell		Bind
 7	Violet	Wand		Tasha's Uncontrollable Hideous Laughter

(*) If the yellow snowball hits on an unmodified die roll of 20, the
victim has been hit in the face and has eaten some of the snow.  It
must then make an additional save vs. poison at a -4 or be violently
ill (no attacks, armour class worsens by 4) for a number of hours equal
to the caster's level.

The material components for the spell are a small rainbow-coloured
marble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kallum's Cold Frost (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a ball of extreme cold and sharp ice particles which
expands outward from its detonation point. All creatures in the area of
effect will take 1d6 hit points of damage per level of the caster from
the cold (save vs. spells for 1/2 damage). All objects in the area of
effect will be frozen, and a layer of frost will cover the surface of
everything in the area of effect. If a creature fails its saving throw
then all of his items must make a saving throw vs. frost or be
destroyed by the extreme cold.

Because of the sharp particles of ice created in the detonation, the
explosion will still cause damage to those who are immune to cold. If a
creature is immune to cold, then the damage will be 1-2 HP per level of
the caster with a saving throw for half as normal.

The spell can do structural damage to wooden structures as can the
Fireball spell.

Otherwise this spell is the same in all respects as Fireball. The
material components for this spell is a handful of glass crystals or
any kind of crystals which is thrown in the direction that the caster
wishes the Iceball to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Missile II (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One or more creatures in a 10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

This improvement on the first level Magic Missile allows the caster to
fire 1 missile per 2 levels of experience.  Each bolt can be
individually targeted and does 1d8 point of damage. The spell fires
that number of missiles every round until the caster is hit or ends the
spell. After the initial casting the missiles have a speed factor of 1
each and the caster may move, or engage in any other action besides
spellcasting after the missiles fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Annoyance (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This is an even more powerful version of the Minor Annoyance and
Annoyance spells (q.v.). It makes the victim's leg hurt, exactly as if
he has barked his shin on something. Although causing no damage, it is
painful enough to disrupt spell casting in the round it is cast in, as
well as subsequent rounds, to the limit of the spell.  The victim also
suffers combat penalties: Armour Class bonuses due to high dexterity are
negated, and attacks are made at a -2 penalty.

A successful save vs. this spell reduces the duration of the spell to
one round per two levels of the caster, and reduces the attack penalty
to -1.

The material component is a coffee bean, carved to look like a
miniature table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malta's Pattern Transport (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can move himself and other materials from
one Pattern to another Pattern. The two Patterns must have the same
image and the destination Pattern must be at least as big in radius as
the source Pattern. Both Patterns must be known to the caster (current
locations) and they must be laid flat. The destination Pattern must not
be supporting any object (even partially). The destination Pattern must
also be uncovered such that there is room for the incoming
creatures/objects.

If all of the above conditions exist, then casting the spell will
transport the caster and any objects/creatures which are completely
supported by the source Pattern to the destination Pattern. All objects
transported will end up on the destination Pattern at the same ratio of
distance to the edge as on the source Pattern. That is, if an object is
halfway from the center to the edge on the source Pattern, then it will
be halfway from the center to the edge on the destination Pattern
(regardless of the size of the destination Pattern).

An object is considered to be completely supported by the pattern when
its weight is supported by the material inscribed in the outer circle
of the Pattern or by something which is itself completely supported.
That means that a person held in the air by another will be transported
only if the holder is completely supported. Flying creatures must not
be flying at the time of transport.

To cast the spell, the caster must stand in the center of an undamaged
Pattern and cast the spell. In the first round of the casting, the
Pattern will begin to glow (each colour of the Pattern will emit its
own colour). Over the next eight rounds, the Pattern brightness will
increase to approximately the same as outside on a sunny day. As the
last word of the spell is stated, the brightness of the Pattern doubles
and all completely supported objects/creatures are transported to the
destination Pattern.

If the destination Pattern is not available (see above), then the
transported objects/creatures are returned to the source Pattern after
one second (and the source Pattern's save is at -4). The source
Pattern is subjected to some heat and other energies in the course of
the transport. These energies cause the source Pattern to make a save
or be damaged (a single crack or burn mark will alter the Pattern and
render it unusable). The destination Pattern is not subjected to the
same amount of energy, so it does not need to make a saving throw.

The lighting conditions at the destination Pattern do not change, so
the transported creatures will have to adjust to the current lighting
(1-2 rounds, depending on lighting).

Some notes:

1) Tossing a rug over an inlaid Pattern prevents incoming transports.

2) Rolling up a rug/cloth Pattern prevents incoming and makes it easier
to transport the Pattern.

3) The only bi-directional Patterns are exactly the same size (hence
the Pattern Image spell).

4) The caster must remain in the middle for all of the casting, but
creatures/objects also transported only have to be on the Pattern in
the last segment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marty's Magic Bow (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0 (arrow range as per normal bows)
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Marty's Magic Bow causes a magical force to propel objects from the
caster's fingers much as a bowstring. With arrows, the effect is to
allow the caster to release one arrow per round, each arrow attacking
as a fighter of 1/2 level of the spellcaster. The advantage of this
spell is the fact that the arrow attacks are not magical: thus there is
no magical saving throw involved for the target, so if the caster makes
his to-hit roll (at 1/2 his level on the fighter table) he hits, even
if the target is, say, in an anti-magic shell, or in a Cube of Force of
Keeps Out All Magic, or if the target is magic resistant.

There's probably a material component (say, a length of string made of
silver thread, or something like that) but the arrows are not
components - i.e. they're not consumed, and you might be able to
reclaim some of them. Also, magical arrows would provide the
appropriate bonuses to hit/damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merkridan's Misplayal (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2"
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One instrument
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes music emanating from a musical instrument to become
twisted and harsh. The musical notes effectively become interchanged.
The target instrument may be either magical or non-magical. Only
magical instruments gain a saving throw (as if the attack were magical
fire) to avoid the spell effects. If a bard is playing an affected
instrument, all bard abilities directly resulting from the playing of
his instrument are lost until the spell expires (or the bard uses a new
instrument). The spell has no effect on sounds from living creatures,
although it could effectively garble communication through instruments
(i.e., signaling drums). It only works on items which are emitting
music at any time while (or up to one round after) the spell is being
cast.

The origins and history of the spell Merkridan's Misplayal are
unknown. This spell was discovered in a lost laboratory complex on the
deserted island of Arremara.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Molten Ground (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2 feet per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes an area of the earth to bubble up molten lava in its
area of effect. After the caster spends one round casting, using up
material components of sulfur and lava rock, the spell begins. In the
first round the ground tremors slightly, and those not wearing heavy
feet covering such as metal boots can feel a slight warmth.

In the second round of the spell the heat becomes very pronounced, and
will ignite paper, cloth, and dry vegetation touching the ground. If
the people in the area of effect did not announce that they were moving
in this round, they are going to be injured.

In the third round the ground becomes molten lava, wooden furniture
bursts into flames, and metals with low melting points start to soften.
Anyone in the area of effect takes 3d6 damage, 2d6 this round only if
wearing thick shoes. In each additional round spent in the area of
effect a person takes 3d6 damage, and any items carried by the person
must safe vs. fire or be destroyed.

The intense heat of the lava may cause structural damage to walls that
are near or in the area of effect. Wooden walls will be destroyed by
fire just like wooden furniture. Protection from Fire will protect a
person but not his items from this spell. Note that lava rock is hard
to obtain in most medieval settings, and that the lava generated by
this spell will not work as a component for later casting (it's marked
by magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Necromantic Bolt (Necromancy)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards + 10 per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses his hand
and then shoots forth, enerringly striking its target. This energy
attacks the life force of any living creature. The creature must roll a
successful save vs. spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of
the caster and 1 point of strength per level of the caster. If the save
is successful, the creature remains unharmed. Creatures not rated for
strength suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for every two caster
levels. Lost strength returns at a rate of 1 point per hour. Damage
must be cured magically or healed naturally over time.

This spell has a special effect on undead creatures. Undead struck by
the bolt suffer no damage or strength loss, but they must successfully
save vs. spell or flee for 1d4 rounds +2 rounds per level of the
caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pander's Improved Identify (Abjuration, Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 feet and 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One item per level
Saving Throw: Special

When Pander's Improved Identify is cast, magical items subsequently
touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately
preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items
and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical
auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again with a new
casting of the spell and the current spell is lost since this higher
level version requires intense concentration. When the spell is cast,
each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of
this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell,
although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw. However,
immediately before handling each item the caster may scan the items for
any cursed properties from a distance of 10 feet without touching the
item. The caster has a 5% chance per level of determining if there is a
curse and also the exact nature of the curse, to a maximum of 90%,
rolled by the DM. Each try is treated as one reading and the caster
need not use a slot to determine the exact nature of a curse unless he
wishes. This part of the divination can only detect curses, not traps.
It should be noted that the caster may not add to the list of original
items that were to be examined once this condition is established. If
the act of detecting for a curse actually triggers one that affects the
caster he may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the curse in
question.

The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to
10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any
roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only
one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e.,
a 5th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five
different items, five different functions or a single item, or any
combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster
cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note
that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified
with this spell.

Exact attack or damage bonuses, charges of an item may be determined;
one per reading. A +1/+4 vs. undead longsword has two individual
functions.

After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it,
the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to
recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the
spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious.
Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored,
which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for unconscious
character).

The material components of this spell are a crushed pearl and jet gem-
stone (of at least 100 GP value each), and an owl feather steeped in
wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is
powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more
potent and the functions of a multi-function item can be learned from a
single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact
or relic might also be learned.

The source of this spell is Pander Pillma.

Pobithakor's Tracer (Divination, Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell was created by an archmage known as Pobithakor the Powerful,
a mage who was better known as Pobithakor the Paranoid. His fear of
absolutely everything around him drove him to take extreme measures to
protect himself.

This spell is cast when the caster is being scried upon (DMG Detection
of Scrying, pg. 141).

If the caster detects that he is being scried upon, by any means, then
the spell can be cast. This spell causes the scrying device to become
two-way. Not only does the scrying creature see the caster, but the
caster can see the scrying creature. Also, whatever powers the scrying
device has, such as clairaudience, then the spell also gives the caster
such powers. The range and area of effect are those of the scrying
device itself. The duration is that of the scrying device. Once the
caster breaks off contact the spell ends. If the scrying creature
breaks off contact, the caster can still scry up to the maximum
duration of the scrying device. The caster will receive all the
information inside his head.

If the scrying creature becomes aware that he is being scried upon and
then casts a dispel magic, the spell will end, but his own scrying
device will become unusable for one day. If the scrying creature casts
a Pobithakor's Protection spell then the Pobithakor's tracer spell will
end and the creature's scrying device will be usable.

This spell can be a useful device for long range communication for
prearranged meetings between two people.

Rathe's Trigger (Conjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One cube foot per level maximum
Saving Throw: Special

The Trigger spell is designed as a defensive spell. When it is cast,
the caster defines a volume which must be at least 1/2 foot in every
dimension. This area begins to glow faintly. The caster then casts
another spell directly upon the Trigger's area. The Trigger's area of
effect must be touched by the caster when applying the second spell.
The glow then vanishes, but both spells remain. The second spell is
held by the Trigger until someone enters or touches the Trigger's area
of effect. At this time the second spell will go off.

If it is an area effect spell (e.g. Fireball, Web) it will be centered
on the center of the Trigger area. Other considerations (the dimensions
of the web, for instance) must be specified at the time of casting the
second spell. Person-affecting spells (e.g. hold person, charm person)
will be applied to the person who triggered the spell. A saving throw
is applicable only if allowed by the second spell. If the caster is in
or touching the Trigger's area of effect, it will not go off. This
allows the caster to escort others safely through the trapped area.

One possible use for this spell is two triggers overlaid in a corridor,
one with a Fireball, and the other, placed slightly behind the first,
with a wall of force. If a person enters the regions from the wrong
direction, the Fireball will go off, and the wall of force will
instantly restrict the blast to one direction. If a person enters the
regions from the other direction, the wall will trigger first and
shield him from the blast. The spells will last until triggered, but if
the second spell is not applied immediately, the trigger will only last
one turn per level of the caster. The material component is a black
pearl of not less than 500 GP value per level of the second spell.

Reconstruct (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One pound per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily resurrects an item that was shattered, burnt, or
disintegrated, so that the forensic wizard may study it. He must gather
as much of the debris as possible, for otherwise the object can be but
partially reassembled, in which case it may be illegible or
unidentifiable. The object will be very fragile, but it may be the
subject of various divination spells such as identify or reveal owner.
The material component is a drop of honey.

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M

Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, hold spells and
dragon induced fear paralysis.

This spell does not remove paralysis already in effect, it just
prevents the recipient from being paralysed in the future.

The material component of this spell is a feather, and an infusion of
tea and ginger which is consumed by the caster.

Rhuva's Spellscan (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hours + 10 minutes per level
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: 10-yard per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Provided the caster is conscious and within the area of effect, he will
be made aware of any spell-casting conducted in that area.  The
particular spell cast is not made known, but the location of the wizard
is, precisely if the caster is familiar with the area, generally
otherwise.  The notification is sufficient to disrupt casting in
progress, unless it is consciously suppressed before casting (if
suppressed, caster does not realise the scan was triggered).  Material
component is a handful of crystal dust.

Sarius' Golden Circles of Protection (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One floating 2' diameter circle plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering circular plates of force which
move around the caster in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
improved by a factor of 1 for every three circles still active and any
successful physical melee attack (less boulders, ballista, or attack
forms similar to dragon's belly flop maneuver) will be deflected
automatically. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective
strength of 21 or greater require a saving throw versus breath weapons
to deflect.

Each circle is able to sustain 6 hit points of damage before
disrupting, so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to
disrupt a circle (chosen randomly) the circle will remain active. For
every 5 circles active, the effects of breath weapons directed at the
caster will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with 1 hit point
damage per die being the maximum reduction allowable. Though, unless
the breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
circle it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of circles in the
process.

While the circles orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for every
circle active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including spells. The
mage may create fewer circles than the maximum possible. The material
component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for every circle
created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they disappear and
are replaced by the floating circles.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Snowball (Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

A snowball is an explosive burst of cold gas, which comes into being
with a loud "whoosh" and delivers damage proportional to the level of
the mage who cast it, i.e. 1d6 per level of the spell caster. The
snowball doesn't expend a considerable amount of pressure, and it will
generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus
covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which
is covered by the snowball is a total volume of roughly 33000 cubic
feet].

Besides causing damage to the target, the snowball freezes all liquids
within its radius. Items exposed to the spell's effects must make a
saving throw to avoid being affected. Items with a creature which makes
its saving throw are considered to be unaffected. The mage points his
finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the snowball
is to come into being. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and
unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the
predescribed range, blossoms into the snowball.

If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point
damage from the spell. Those who make their saving throw manage to
dodge, fall flat or roll aside, and thus take only half damage from the
effect of the spell. The material component of this spell is a hollow
crystal filled with water; suspended in the water are tiny white quartz
flakes. [cf. Fireball]

Sonoric's Magic Tracker (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to illuminate the tracks of any
being of which he has a some item that was in contact with the being a
number of turns equal to the caster's level previously. The item could
be anything from a shirt, to a scrap of hair, or drop of blood. The
tracks are only visible to the caster, and only tracks within the area
of effect are visible.

The spell only illuminates tracks within the spell's area of effect
(which moves with the caster), and will only illuminate tracks made on
a solid surface (i.e. if the being being tracked took to flight, or
dove into water, the trail would end there).  However, if the caster is
able to reach the spot where the trail was resumed (i.e. the being
being tracked wades out of a river at a certain spot), the caster may
resume tracking.

It is up to the caster to determine which direction leads to the most
recent tracks (i.e. which are coming and which are going), although the
spell does illuminate a "footprint" of the being which is being
tracked. The spell will allow the caster to track the being if it
climbed walls, and even if it tried to obscure its path, by throwing
dirt over it. Objects over 3" thick covering the path, however, do
obscure it.

The material component of the spell is some thing which had been in
contact with the creature to be tracked, up to the caster's level in
turns previously. Once the spell is cast, the caster need not carry the
item with him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sonoric's Trance (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to mimic the actions of a creature,
provided the actions occurred within a number of turns equal to the
caster's level. During the casting of the spell, the caster must touch
some object which the target creature was in contact with for at least
a round, and that contact must not have occurred more than the caster's
level in hours previously.

Upon casting the spell, the caster goes into a trance, during which he
loses all control of his actions (save vs.  spells at -4 to break
spell), and begins mimicing the most recent actions of the target,
provided the actions occurred within the area of effect. The spell does
not allow the caster to mimic actions of which he is incapable, such as
climing walls, or broad jumping 20', and the caster merely imitates any
spells the target may have cast, and doesn't actually cast the spell
(although observers may recognise the spell he is attempting to cast).
If the target did something which would take it outside of the area of
effect, such as rapid movement beyond the abilities of the caster, or
teleportation, the spell is broken.

The caster must decide how far back in time he would like to begin
mimicing the actions of the target. The actions of the target may take
the caster beyond the original area of effect, but there is a 10'
radius sphere over which is determined whether or not the target left
the area of effect.

The caster has the option of casting such movement spells as fly and
feather fall, prior to Trance, to facilitate movement such as climbing,
and even flying, and to take the pain out of such actions as falling
(if the target was a clutz). The target must be man sized, and
humanoid.

The caster's trance will be broken by such things as damage, slapping,
and other unpleasant stimuli.

Soul Safe (Abjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the Necromancer stores the soul of the recipient in a
piece of jet, the material component. While his soul is thus protected,
a character suffers a penalty of -2 to attack rolls and saving throws,
he does not heal naturally, and magical healing functions on him at
only half normal efficacy. If the character is slain by undead while
under the effects of this spell, however, his soul cannot be corrupted
and forced to rise as undead itself (though the body can still be
animated as a zombie or skeleton). If the soul safe is destroyed, or if
the spell expires, the soul will return (across any distance) to its
body, unless that body is dead, in which case it will journey to its
final resting place. This spell affects only races with souls:
dwarves, halflings, and humans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spirit Call (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This summons one incorporeal spirit of hit dice equal to one half the
caster's level from the astral plane. The round after it is summoned,
it will begin to perform services for the wizard. In its native form,
it is a powerful Unseen Servant which can go up to 100 yards from the
wizard, lift 50 pounds per hit die, and fly at 18". This form has a
punch for 1d6 damage, AC 0, and takes one point of damage from any
weapon blow.

Secondly, it may provide animating force to a body or statue, in which
case it uses whatever weapons or armour are available (a stone statue
will be AC 0, damage 2d6 or by weapon, move 9" unless affixed or
possessing wings).

Thirdly, it may attempt to take over the body of one enemy creature.
The being so affected is allowed a save, and the spirit will be forced
back to the astral plane immediately if the save is successful. If the
save fails, effects are as a Domination spell for the duration of the
Spirit Call, but the domination cannot force someone to use magic (the
Spirit would not understand the instructions). A spirit who has less
than 1/2 of its hit points left will be unable to possess someone.

The material component is a piece of candy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stren's Improved Floating Disk (Conjuration, Evocation)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an improved version of Tenser's Floating Disk. The big
improvement is the speed of the disk - now 30". The disk can also move
from 3' to 30' off the ground/water. The disk movement is based
relative to the caster, which prevents the caster from riding their own
disk. However, if two casters use this spell, they can ride each others
to travel. This travel can either be in the form of independent
movement (tricky to communicate since somebody else is steering yours)
or master-slave. In the master-slave travel, one caster steers a disk
while he rides on a disk which stays the same distance from its
caster.

S1 <---> S2 <---> M

Caster 1 is the master and riding in the back (caster 3's disk). Caster
2 is in the front riding on the master's disk - his own disk stays x
feet behind him. Caster 3 rides in the middle and his disk also stays
x feet behind him. Caster 1 steers the chain while the other two can
sleep, eat, cast spells, etc. I have this written down at home, but I
believe that all other parameters are the same as Tenser's Floating
Disk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suggest Illusion (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature per 3 levels of the caster
Saving Throw: Negates

This devious spell causes a targeted creatures to believe that they
have just discovered and successful disbelieved an illusion. This is a
bit of misdirection caused by the caster, as the item selected by the
caster to be believed as an illusion could actually be real.

This spell could be great for causing enemies of the caster to walk
into a pit because it "does not really exist".

If the victim has a reason to believe that a so called illusion is
actually not an illusion, then he get a saving throw vs. illusion to
actually determine if the item is an illusion or not.

The material component of this spell is a bit of burning incense, which
of course adds to a magical "atmosphere", thus making the victims
believe even harder that they are really seeing an illusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
View Past (Divination)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: one hour
Area of Effect: 5-foot per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

The spell is cast on an area, and allows the caster to create a
three-dimensional image of the past in that location. The caster
specifies the time in the past by the material component: one gold
piece equivalent of gold dust is used for each hour back that is
viewed. Thus if the caster uses 24 GP worth of dust, he can view a
period starting roughly 24 hours in the past through the duration of
the spell (a tenth level caster could view the period from 24 hours in
the past to 24 hours - 100 minutes, that is 22 hours and 20 minutes, in
the past).

After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 1d20 - 10 to determine the
error in the time frame. Thus if the DM rolls 5 - 10 = -5, the time
viewed is actually N hours and 5 minutes in the past; a roll of 10-10 =
0 indicates exactly the right amount of gold was consumed.

The caster should roll 1d20 to determine the clarity of the casting. A
1 indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a fog; a 20
indicates a crystal-clear picture. This roll can be repeated in
subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty of seeing through
time.

Events that were cloaked by spells that hide themselves from
Clairvoyance also mask out View Past, and can never be seen using this
spell.

Wimbly's Enwrapment (Alteration)
Level: 3
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a little blob of a sticky, web-like material
flies toward it's target and completely wraps it in a very strong, very
sticky webs. The webs cannot be broken unless the target creature has
at least a 23 strength.

To determine if the blob hits, roll the attack as if the blob was a
monster of hit dice equal to the caster's level.

There are 3 applications of this spell: 1) As a glowing sigil drawn in
the air by the caster and pointed at the intended target; 2) As a glyph
marked on a surface that is touched or gazed upon; 3) As a small
character written on some magic work to protect it.

The material components of this spell are some strands of web that a
giant spider uses to bind up its captured prey.
