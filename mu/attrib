Many thanks to cscon113@uoft02.utoledo.edu, who accumulated a lot of
these spells. When he started out, he was going to put each author's
name next to each spell. Then he started getting two and three copies
of the same spell, and decided to just put their names here, so if you
have a question, get in touch with one of these people, not with him
or me.

Note that some of the spells contained in the Great Net Spellbook have
been copyrighted by the author. Permission has been granted by these
authors to copy and freely distribute copies of their work, so long as
no commercial or barter considerations are obtained in exchange for such
copies. All spells are for personal use only. If you distribute these
spells, you must also distribute these copyright conditions and the
names of the authors and editors.

After receiving these spells, I have gone through all of them, edited
them to make the format uniform, and to make them more legible. Note
that I did not change the wordings in any way, except in some obvious
cases of spelling errors. Furthermore, when no level was indicated, I
(or cscon113@uoft02.utoledo.edu) just guessed what level it was to be
in. Also, in those cases where no school, range, area of effect, or the
like was supplied, I made one up.

Game Masters should be sure to check these spells, and make sure they
are right for the way you run your campaign. Some are awfully powerful
but some could use a little more kick, that is for you to decide.

==========

* The following spells were researched by Llewllynn. For those who are
interested, Llewllynn is a high level mage of Lawful Neutral alignment
(hence the Detect Chaos and Protection from Chaos spells). As for
access to druidical spells, he is married to Evaine, a half-elven
druid; as for cleric spells, he helped build the major temple to his
goddess on the world he lives in.

Boudewijn's note: You might not want to use these spells in your own
campaign, since it might disturb the balance between clerics/druids and
magic users.

Acid Hands			Major Globe of Invulnerability
Cone of Acid			Protection from Chaos
Cone of Fire			Protection from Chaos, 10 Foot Radius
Delayed Blast Snowball		Resist Acid
Detect Chaos			Resist Cold
Frost Hands			Resist Electricity
Hydro Shield			Resist Fire
Llewllynn's Wall of Force	Snowball
