Jamye's Appearing Ink (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip turns a small amount of ink (up to one pint) into water.
The ink remains clear and colourless until it dries, at which time it
reverts to its normal state.  The material component is the ink
itself.

The reverse, Jamye's Disappearing Ink, turns up to a pint of water into
an inky liquid that evaporates like water, leaving no trace when it
dries.

Pitch (Evocation)
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip sounds a perfectly-tuned note from out of nowhere. The
note is centered on the caster, and can be heard from a distance of 20
feet. Things that block normal noise (walls, curtains, Silence 15'
Radius, etc.) block this as well.

This spell is useful for tuning instruments "by ear", or with the help
of a Tune cantrip. It is also slightly disturbing to those around the
caster, as any single note would be if held out for two rounds.

To cast this cantrip, the bard must speak out loud the name of the note
he wishes to hear, such as "Middle C", "B Flat", or "Quarter-step above
the first F Sharp above High C".

Silvadel's Magic Feather (Enchantment)
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One feather
Saving Throw: None

This spell simply allows the caster to control a feather. This is very
useful for writing things secretly, or for tickling someone. It is
related to the Unseen servant spell... The material component for this
spell is a feather. It lasts until concentration is broken.

Stepping Stones (Evocation)
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1/10 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 4 spheres, 1' diameter each
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip creates 4 spheres of force approximately 1' in diameter.
They can be place anywhere within 20' of each other, and last
approximately 1/10 round per level of the caster. Magical combat of
just about any sort will destroy these very useful discs so try not to
use them in combat.

Tune (Alteration) Reversible
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V or M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

With this cantrip, the bard can bring one note of an instrument in tune
with either a hummed note, the equivalent note played by a second
instrument (in which case the component of the spell is that other
instrument, which is obviously not consumed in the casting; what good
would that do?), or the result of a preceding Pitch cantrip (q.v.). The
one note will end up perfectly in tune with the reference note. As many
instruments as are in the area of effect can be brought into tune at
once.

A well-Tuned instrument (with two or more Tuned notes) has the effect
of making the bard's songs more melodious and enjoyable; this has the
game effects of reducing the saving throws of hostile creatures vs. the
bard's mood-altering story telling by 1, as well as making the bard's
morale-boosting song affect the listeners for half again as long (i.e.
one and a half rounds per level) as it usually does.

Too many notes perfectly Tuned on an instrument, however, will have a
negative effect on other bards in the area, who will realise that the
Tuned instrument has been magically altered to sound so perfect. For
each note above one that the instrument has been Tuned, the hostile
bard personally gets a +1 to his saving throw vs. the playing bard's
friendly effects.

Although the Tuning is instantaneous, the effects of the cantrip last
for a while. In perfect conditions (humidity on the low side,
comfortable temperature, no rough handling), the instrument will stay
Tuned for a week.  In less than perfect conditions (typical adventuring
abuse, for example), the instrument will have to be re-Tuned every day.
If the instrument is taken apart for storage, such as flutes or other
woodwinds are, the instrument will have to be re-Tuned every time it is
reassembled.

The reverse of this cantrip, Untune, causes one note of the specified
instrument to become horribly out of tune.  It also has the side effect
of turning the caster's hands a brilliant red for one turn after the
cantrip is cast, unfortunately.

Umbrella (Abjuration)
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

As with all cantrips this one can be very useful though not very
powerful. It manifests itself as a field of force that resembles an
umbrella. It lasts for up to one hour per level of caster as a maximum
though if the concentration of the caster is broken for more than 1
minute it will fade away. It actually does have some form and is
"worth" 6 hit points though only magical weapons will affect it.

Vision (Alteration)
Level: 0
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Allows the caster to see things in the distance up to three times
better for the duration of this spell. It will also allow him to see
things more clearly as they appear to be only one third of the distance
from them. It does cause some problems though with trying to see things
close up. The spell duration may be ended at any time.
