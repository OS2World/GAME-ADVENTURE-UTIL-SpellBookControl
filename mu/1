Acid Hands (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that the caster's hands eject a corrosive acid. Damage
is one hit point per level of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahrvar's Forgery (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to perfectly duplicate the any
style of handwriting of which he has a sizable sample. The forgery is
good enough to fool even the closest scrutinisation, although it does
radiate faint magic.

The caster merely casts the spell, and begins writing. His handwriting
will perfectly match that of the sample, for the length of the spell's
duration. Those watching the caster write will believe that the
handwriting on the page is actually that of the caster, unless of
course they witness the casting of the spell, which may make them
rather suspicious. The caster need not be writing the entire duration
of the spell; he is free to stop and resume writing any number of times
within the duration. Also, the caster only needs the handwriting sample
to be copied during the initial casting of the spell.

The material component of this spell is a sample of the handwriting to
be copied (containing an example of every letter in the alphabet to be
used), and a writing instrument.

Alpha's Acid Stream (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

The spell causes a thin stream of purplish, hissing acid to shoot forth
from the caster's outstretched hand, out to the maximum range of the
spell.  This acid causes 1d4 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 8d4.  The intended target may attempt a save vs.
petrification to dodge the jet of acid (save at -4 if size G, -2 if
size H, -1 if size L, +1 if size S, and +3 if size T), and if
successful the jet of acid will have been avoided, and will continue on
in a straight line out to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the
path of the acid must save as above or be struck by the spell.  The
Acid Stream can affect only one target in any event.  The material
component is a drop of any acid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Electric Arc (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes an arc of electricity to leap from the caster's
extended fingertip.  This electricity unerringly strikes one target of
the caster's choice, inflicting 1d4 damage, plus one point per level of
the caster (up to a maximum of +12), with no saving throw.  A target in
metal armour or wielding a large, mostly metallic weapon (e.g. any
sword, battle axe) must save vs. spells and, if the save is failed, the
bonus (i.e. per level) damage inflicted by the spell is doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Hunting Hound (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 12 turns + 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell calls a canine creature to be a helper and boon companion to
the spell caster for the duration of the spell.  The type of hound
summoned depends upon the caster's level, but the hound will always
understand verbal commands given it, so long as they are 12 words or
less and relatively simple.  The hound will further also be capable of
tracking as if a ranger of half the level of the summoner, and can hunt
sufficiently well to feed the spell-caster for one day, provided there
is game extant in the caster's area.

 The type of hound summoned is as follows:

  1st -  3rd level: jackal
  4th -  7th level: wild dog
  8th - 12th level: wolf
 13th +      level: dire wolf

If the caster takes a lower-level hound (or a dire wolf when 18th
level), it will have maximum hit points, be +1 to hit and on damage,
track at +1 level, and can understand even relatively complex commands
of up to 50 words in length.  The material component is a piece of
fresh meat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Sparkle Beam (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1' x 20' x 5' cone
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws upon the power of the Positive Material Plane and
calls forth a ray of golden light.  Anyone in the area of effect of the
spell must save vs. petrification or be blinded for 1 round.  The true
function of this spell, however, is its use against undead, creatures
of the Lower Planes, and those drawing power from the Negative Material
Plane or the Plane of Shadow.  Such creatures suffer 1d4 damage, plus
an additional 1d4 at every even level of the caster (e.g. 4d4 at 8th),
up to a maximum of 8d4.  These creatures may save vs. spells to halve
this damage.  The material component is a bit of crushed sunstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Starlight (Evocation, Illusion)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level area
Saving Throw: None

This spell illuminates an area as a cloudless outdoor night sky filled
with stars.  This light is pale and wan, and dilutes vision mostly to
black and white.  Full visual acuity is possible only out to a range of
10 yards, but general identification can be made out to 20 yards.

Stationary figures can be made out at 40 yards, and movement detected
out to 80 yards.  Intervening cover will, of course, reduce sighting
distances accordingly.  This light does not interfere with infravision,
and there are ample shadows within the area of effect to hide in.  The
illusionary component of the spell creates the appearance of an actual
starry night sky.  The area of effect is stationary.  The material
component is a piece of black velvet and a few bits of glass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Wall of Darkness (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' per level x 10' per level area
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a wall of blackness which cannot
be seen through, even with infravision or ultravision.  It is dispelled
instantly by a light or continual light (q.v.) spell.  It has no
physical existence, and does not hinder nor harm those passing through
it.  It does, however, block the passage of sound from one side to the
other, assuming that the spell is not cast in such a way (such as in a
field of grass) which would otherwise allow sound to move around the
edges of the wall.  The material component is some pitch and soot, or a
lump of coal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animal (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration See below
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One animal formed per level
Saving Throw: Special

An illusion of one or more small animals can be brought into being by
means of this spell. The animals must be of a sort very familiar to the
magic user, and each can be no larger than a fox, a rabbit, or a
medium hawk. Animals created can be of more than one type. The illusion
is visual and auditory, being much like a specialised form of the
second level magic user spell Improved Phantasmal Force.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Association (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 surfaces
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the forensic wizard must brings two surfaces
into contact with one another. Possibilities include the surface of a
jewel and that of a safe, or the surface of an arrow and that of a
bow. If the two surfaces were ever before adjacent, the spell so
indicates, and if the surfaces were ever directly connected as a single
item, an even stronger reading results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azalldam's Fabricated Bridge (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10 yard per level x 5 yard bridge
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster conjures material from the plane of
shadows and uses it to shape a semi-real bridge. This bridge is 5 yards
wide and is 10 yards long per level of the caster; both ends of the
bridge must rest on solid ground. The bridge will support 100 pounds
per level of the caster; any additional weight will cause it to
collapse. The bridge will normally last for 2 rounds per level of the
caster, but the caster may end the spell with a single word.

The bridge is not an illusion per se, and so cannot be disbelieved; it
may however, be dispelled normally.

The material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of a
bridge; this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cat Spirit (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

The cat form spell grants many of the abilities traditionally
associated with cats, though it does not significantly alter the
features of the recipient. The spell grants a +2 bonus to stealth, as
the recipient's tread will be absolutely quiet for the duration. The
spell also halves all damage taken from falls and allows the recipient
to land on his feet. Finally, it grants the ability to grow claws,
allowing each hand to do 1d3 damage. It does not, however, improve
singing ability. The material component is whiskers from a cat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coloration (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level maximum
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a chosen surface to change colour, glow, or both, be
it a section of wall, a box, a sword, or a creature (a saving throw
vs.  magic will negate the effect if the subject is unknowing or
unwilling). Multiple colours can be chosen (up to 256 different colours
and shades). If made to glow, the object will emit light for a range of
five feet. The material component for colour is a small amount of die
or ink of the appropriate colour, and to cause a glow the spell
consumes a bit of phosphor or a glowworm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comeliness (Illusion/Phantasm) Reversible
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None (Negates)

A comeliness spell will increase a creatures comeliness score (or
decrease it if the reverse is cast) by means of illusion. The change in
points is dependent upon the recipient's present comeliness:

 Increase in Comeliness		Decrease in Comeliness
 --------------------------	--------------------------
 Present	Change in	Present		Change in
 Score		Comeliness	Score		Comeliness
 --------	----------	----------	----------
 up to 06	2 - 8		up to 06	1
 07 to 12	2 - 7		06 to 07	1 - 2
 13 to 15	1 - 6		08 to 09	1 - 4
 16 to 17	1 - 4		10 to 12	1 - 6
 18 to 19	1 - 2		13 to 16	2 - 7
 20 +		1		17 or more	2 - 8

An unwilling victim receives a saving throw, which, if successful, will
negate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Poisoning (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the forensic wizard can determine if a corpse has been
poisoned. One corpse can be checked each round. The wizard can
determine the means by which the poison was administered and the place
at which it entered the body, and he has a 5% chance per level of being
able to exactly identify the poison.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diminutive Darkness (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None (Negates)

This spell is very similar to the first level magic user spell
Darkness (see also the second level magic user spell Darkness). It has
only a 2-foot radius, however. This gives the spell many different
uses.  For example, it can be used to block the light of a torch,
lantern, magic sword, etc. This would prevent all sorts of vision only
within the 2-foot radius, so one could still see about with infravision
or ultravision (or normal vision, if there is another light source). It
can blind a creature as a light spell would without creating light that
could alert others, and also without obscuring the caster's own sight
as would a normal darkness spell (if cast upon a creature or its
possessions carried, the creature gets a saving throw, and if the throw
is made, the darkness appears 5' behind). The spell can cancel a light
spell, but has no effect on continual light or ambient light.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drowse (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the illusion in the victim mind that she or he is
extremely exhausted, and in fact on the verge of collapsing and falling
asleep. There is no saving throw. The victim will suffer a -4 to hit,
-2 on AC, 50% vision and 1/2 her or his normal movement rate for the
full duration of the spell. Spell casters will have a chance of spell
failure equal to 100% - 5% per point of their prime requisite (use
intelligence or wisdom). The spell can be negated by Dispel Illusion or
Dispel Exhaustion (but not by dispel magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Electric Blades (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2 blades
Saving Throw: None

This spell must be cast with a metal blade of some sort in each hand.
Both blades then acquire a flickering blue glow.  When a hit by either
blade is scored it causes 1-4 more points of damage of electricity. If
both blades hit the same target in the same round the victim must save
versus petrification or be stunned for one round. Each blade only
shocks once and then is normal again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fellstar's Flame Finger (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 25 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a thin bolt of searing flames shoots forth
from the caster's index finger. This bolt will automatically hit a
single target inflicting 1d10 points of damage, plus 1 point per level
of the caster, up to a maximum of 1d10+10. A successful save vs. spell
reduces this damage by half.  If a save is failed, possessions do not
have to make a save, unless they were targeted specifically by the
spell, in which case the owner suffers no damage, but the object must
save vs. magical fire (at +2) or be destroyed (only one object may be
targeted per casting).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find Water (Divination)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1 mile, depth 10 feet per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One twig
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the diviner grasps two ends of a Y-shaped
twig. The remaining end twists around to point in the direction of the
nearest source of fresh water within the spell range. The branch can
twist but twenty degrees, and then the diviner will feel a tug in the
direction of the water. The diviner can specify a minimum amount of
water to seek (greater than the amount in a human body, for example).
Also, he can restrict the depth at which to seek the water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flash (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Victims failing their saving throw are blinded for the next round due
to a flash of light that appears in their eyes. All to-hit rolls for
the next two rounds are made at -2 due to spots in their eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frost Hands (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that ice is ejected. Damage is one hit point per level
of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frost Touch (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell delivers 1d6 points of damage. In addition to this, you add
1 point of damage for every level above first. Cold based creatures are
immune to this, and fire based creatures take double damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guilda's Treacherous Tripwire (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One tripwire
Saving Throw: Negates

One wire (up to 10' long) can be stretched across a hall, or such.  The
wire becomes camouflaged--undetectable w/o find traps.  The first
creature tO attempt to pass must save vs. wands (add dexterity
defensive adjustment) or be caught when the wire springs free.  The
wire will twine tightly about the ankles of its victim, tripping him.
It must then be tediously untangled (or sawed loose) which will take at
least 30 seconds under ideal conditions.  If hacked loose in combat, it
will take 1 round, and the victim will take 1d4 damage unless an
enchanted blade is used (which will cut without effort).  Note that the
wire is required, but not consumed. The material component is a small
spring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human Torch (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the caster and all his clothing to become engulfed in
flames. These flames do not harm the caster or his equipment but cause
1d4 points of damage to anyone within 5' and an additional 1d6 to
anyone who actually touches him. The flames themselves are only about
as hot as a torch but the surrounding area will feel like a blast
furnace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inaudibility (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell completely masks all sounds made by the recipient: bodily
functions such as breathing and sleeping as well as sounds made by
striking another object (walking, for example). Any object held by the
recipient is likewise silenced. Objects thrown, dropped, or knocked
over by the recipient are not under the effect of the spell, however,
and these may make noise at the ends of their trajectories. An
unwilling victim receives a saving throw against this spell. The
material component is a bit of cotton.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insolence (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes its victims to sound and appear crude, insulting and
arrogant, in all that she or he says or does, to all observers. The
victim, however, will not be aware that anything is amiss. While the
general meaning of whatever is said will be the same, the illusion
causes observers to see and hear a twisted version in which the speaker
is so insolent that all reactions are checked at -50%. Additionally,
such speech might not be tolerated at all in some situations (for
example, automatic dismissal from a king's court, or perhaps even
worse...). Even if the target makes her or his saving throw, the attack
will not be noticed (unless the somatic and verbal gestures of the
caster are seen and recognised).

If an observer has reason to believe that something is amiss, she or he
gains as saving throw if an attempt is made to disbelieve. Such a
saving throw is made at +4 if the fact that it is an illusion has been
communicated. If these saving throws are failed, it still appears
real.

The material component is a bit of dung or spittle, which is wrapped in
the magic user's hand. The hand is then subtly waived at the creature
to be affected. The verbal component is a low guttural sound made in
the throat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamye's Melodramatic Music (Alteration, Conjuration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One intelligent creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The spell causes the music to be played whenever the victim performs
certain actions; such as entering a room, charging into battle, or
making an announcement. The type of music is determined by the caster.

Material components for this spell are: a miniature golden horn,
mustache wax, a short length of rope, and a lace handkerchief.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kazago's Lock Pick (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 day + 1 day per 5 levels
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the bard to pick locks. The bard's Pick Pockets
percentage roll becomes an Open Locks percentage roll, and the bard is
treated as a thief in this respect for the entire duration of the
spell.

This spell is different from both the second-level Knock spell and the
Unlock cantrip in that it can possibly affect much more than one lock,
and that its effects are far less certain. It is especially useful on
fact-finding missions where the bard is worried about coming across
many locked doors along the way.

The material components for this spell are a set of thieves' picks and
tools, which are not consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last Image (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

When the forensic wizard casts this spell, he sees whatever the
recipient corpse saw at the very instant of death, with the intent of
learning the identity of the murderer, or at least the location of
death. If the recipient was killed by a gaze attack, the wizard suffers
this attack as well, but with a +4 bonus to his saving throw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesser Invisible Object (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One object not larger than 3 cube feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes an object to vanish from sight, much like the second
level magic user spell invisibility (which affected only creatures).
The spell lasts only 2 rounds per level of the caster or until the
caster wills it to end. For example, a quiver of arrows or a bow could
be made invisible and carried, and when desired, a moments thought
could make them appear. Note that not even the caster can see the
invisible object, so if she or he is to use it most effectively, it may
be necessary to make it visible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Death (Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60'
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell may be cast on any living (not golem, undead, etc.) creature
native to the Prime Material plane and with 6+4 or less hit dice. The
victim must save vs. magic at -3 or fall paralysed for 1d4 + 1 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mental Notepad (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: See below
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to store information in the unused
portions of his brain for later recall.

The information thus stored will be available for complete recall as if
the caster was reading the information from a parchment in his hands.

The caster is able to store up to two pages of information in the brain
through the use of this spell.

If at a later time, the caster wishes to add more information, it
change the information that is current in his brain, then the caster
will be required to recast the spell and re-memorise the information
again.

There can only be one spell active in the casters brain at anyone
time.

The material component of this spell is a lead crystal sheet of no less
than 50 GP value which disappears after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor Annoyance (Illusion)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates the illusion (sound and feel) of a mosquito flying
into the victim's ear. The victim will then act appropriately, which
usually means stopping and trying to get the illusionary mosquito out
of his ear, until either a successful saving throw vs. spell is made,
or the spell expires.

The spell takes effect at the beginning of the round after it is cast.
This means that it cannot be used to interrupt a spell, although it can
be used to keep spells from being cast in the round(s) afterward.

The victim gets a saving throw at the time of the casting, and then at
the end of each round thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor Mimicry (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell allows the magic user to make the creature touched to appear
as something else for the duration of the spell. The illusion has
visual and minor auditory (such as crackling of fire, mumbling, etc.,
similar to Improved Phantasmal Force) components only. The form is
chosen by the magic user, and unwilling creatures gain a saving throw.
The illusion can be as small as half the size of the creature masked,
and as large as something that would fit within 1/4 cubic" + 1/4 cubic"
per level. Once the form is taken, it remains almost stationary, with
only minor movement possible; for example, a troll illusion could growl
and make threatening motions but could not walk and attack, and a fire
could dance and crackle but could not spread.  For this reason, objects
are the forms most often chosen. Movement is not possible for the
recipient creature if the spell is to be maintained, as this would
break the spell. If the recipient remains still or nearly still,
however, the spell will last so long as the magic user maintains faint
concentration (spell casting and taking damage break the spell, but
talking and walking do not) and remains within 1" per level of the
location of the recipient (obviously not a problem if the magic user
and the recipient are the same person). If the spell is broken for any
reason, it will last a further 1-3 rounds + 1 round per level of the
caster. The illusion does not follow any movement made by its
recipient.

The caster of this spell can check one weapon per round to determine if
it was used to kill a specific corpse, of whom he has a blood sample. A
"murder weapon" is one which reduced the victim to zero hit points, or
delivered the poison which did so.

Painting (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2" high cube
Saving Throw: Negates

By the means of this spell the caster can create an illusion of
whatever he wants, as long as he concentrates and the illusion remains
in the area of effect. It is usually easy to recognise what the
illusion is supposed to be of, but any creature that can do so can also
recognise that it is an illusion.

Personal Magnetism (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

By means of this spell, a mage is able to endow a single target
creature with a magical field which causes all creatures within the
area of effect (of the same basic species) to be drawn toward the
target creature, much in the say way that metal is attracted to a
lodestone. The spell will affect target creatures of up to 4 + 2 HD. A
saving throw (vs. spells) will totally negate this spell, but the hit
dice of the target creature modify its saving throw in the following
manner:

 less than 1 HD: -4 to save,
 less than 2 HD: -3 to save,
 less than 3 HD: -2 to save,
 less than 4 HD: -1 to save,
 4 HD or more: normal save.

Creatures that have magical auras are totally immune to this spell.
This includes dragons, cockatrice, etc.

If the spell dweomer successfully affects the target creature it will
then attempt to attract all surrounding creatures of the same species,
causing them to move at their normal movement rate (and locomotion)
toward the target creature. The area of effect is sphere around the
target creature which extends outward 1" per level of the spellcaster,
up to a maximum of a 10" radius. The number of creatures within the
area of effect which the dweomer will attempt to attract is equal to
twice the current level of the spellcaster. The mage is unable to
change this number in any way and may himself be affected by the
dweomer (if of the same species as the target creature) if caught
within the area of effect. For purposes of this spell, hybrids are
considered an individual species, so half-orcs would only attract other
half-orcs, not other orcs and/or humans.

The area of effect is stronger near the target creature and therefore
has more of a chance to attract a being toward the target than at the
outer limits of the sphere. The outer 1" area of the sphere's influence
will always allow creatures to save (vs. spells against the attraction
normally. But, for every 1" closer the creature(s) is penalised by a
cumulative -1 modifier to its saving throw. Here are examples of a 1st
level, 5th level, and 10th level plus mage casting this spell:

 1st level Mage

 Range:  1" -0- 1"
 Save:   0      0

 5th level Mage

 Range:  5" 4" 3" 2" 1" -0- 1" 2" 3" 4" 5"
 Save:   0 -1 -2 -3 -4     -4 -3 -2 -1  0

 10th level Mage

 Range: 10" 9" 8" 7" 6" 5" 4" 3" 2" 1" -0- 1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6" 7" 8" 9" 10"
 Save:   0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9     -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0

A successful saving throw against the attraction means that the spell
is unable to attract this creature toward the target creature.

Note that the mage may reduce the size of the area of effect to less
than he is able to affect (in 1" decrements) but the saving throw
modifiers are a product of the size of the area of effect, not the
level of the mage casting the spell. This means that if a 10th level
mage reduces the area of effect to a 1" sphere it would only be able to
affect creatures within 1" of the target creature and they would
receive a normal save, but he will still able to try to attract 20
creatures toward the target whereas the 1st level mage would only be
able to attract 2. Also, remember that the area of effect is three
dimensional, and can affect creatures through any material that does
not shield against magic (e.g., lead). Creatures that are physically
unable to become "stuck" to the target will stick to whatever physical
object is blocking their path, such as walls, floors, doors, etc.

If any creatures become "stuck" to the target creature, it and whatever
is stuck to it become entangled with each other, effectively reducing
their normal movement rate to 0". Creatures being drawn toward the
target are totally unable to attack, but may attack from the mass with
one attack form per round if the attack does not require melee combat
(e.g., breath weapon, gaze, etc.). If the combat form requires physical
contact, a "stuck" creature is only entitled to attack once per round
and only if it is first attacked by someone striking at it while it is
entangled. Attacks on entangled creatures are at +4 to hit, and the
creature(s) are penalised -3 on the return attack. Also, creatures so
entangle lose all armour class bonuses for dexterity.

The material component of this spell is a lodestone of at least 2 GP in
weight. It will disintegrate if the target creature successfully saves
against the spell. Otherwise, it is reusable, and only need be touched
during the casting to act as a focus for the mage.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Protection from Chaos (Abjuration) Reversible
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to protection from evil (q.v.) except in its
purpose and intent; it keeps out chaotic, as well as summoned or
enchanted creatures. It acts as magical armour on the recipient; the
protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus
preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or summoned or
chaotic nature. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from
the protected being.

Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by chaotic creatures incur a
penalty of -2 from dice rolls to hit the protected creature, and any
saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected
being's dice. This spell can be reversed to become protection from law,
although it still keeps out enchanted or summoned chaotic creatures as
well.

To complete this spell, the mage must trace a 3 feet diameter circle
upon the floor/ground with powdered obsidian for protection from law
and powdered glass for protection from chaos; or in the air using
burning incense or burning dung with respect to law/chaos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection from Rain (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

After casting this spell, the wizard will remain dry even if standing
in the midst of a torrent. The caster is protected from splashes and
falling drops, but he is not protected from more concentrated bodies
such as puddles. The water will simply bead and flow down an invisible
field which surrounds the caster and his clothing at a distance of
about one inch. An oiled leather rag is the material component of this
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quantas's Target Bow (Enchantment)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One bow
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any arrows fired from the bow (which may
not be a crossbow) are +2 to hit a specific target. The caster must be
able to see the target, and call his shot. The +2 only affects hits on
the target, not on someone or something that gets in the way.

If the target is in melee, the target gets a +2 to it's size rating
when the DM determines the odds of hitting the target as opposed to
those around it. For example, if firing on a size six giant who is in
melee with a size two elf, there would normally be a one in three
chance to hit the elf. With target bow in effect, the giant would be
raised to size eight, giving only a one in four chance to hit the elf.
Should the arrow go at the elf anyway, it would not get its +2 to hit
(since the giant is the target).

Note that the arrow fired from the target bow is in no way magical. The
material component is a feather from a bird of prey, rubbed against the
bow string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand Skin (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Save: None

By this spell, the caster will cover himself with sand that will repel
damage.  The caster will be able to cover himself with enough sand to
block 8 + 1 per level points of damage.  The type of sand used causes
the body to be slightly shaded to that colour.  The spell lasts until
all the points are used up.  Multiple casting only raises you back to
the maximum of a single casting.

The material components needed are: ground granite, sandstone, or some
other type of fine sand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sangfroid (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers immunity to all "nuisance" cantrips and first-level
spells cast upon the bard. In addition, it gives the bard a +4 bonus to
his saving throws vs. nuisance spells of second level or higher.

Nuisance spells are those that do no damage, but are designed to
adversely affect the bard's concentration, train of thought, or senses.
Most Illusion and Charm spells fall into this category, as do
Blindness, Deafness, and such spells that otherwise cause blindness or
deafness.  All three variations of the Annoyance spell (q.v.) are
included as well. There are more such spells, but an exhaustive list
here is unwarranted.

This spell is primarily used while performing, as it keeps outside
events such as hecklers and Taunt spells from interrupting the bard's
performance.

The material component for this spell is a chip of granite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadows (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0 or 6" (see below)
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: None

This spell has three different potential functions, the choice of which
may be made at the time of casting:

#1: The magic user may cast shadows upon herself or himself, with this
covering giving her or him a chance of hiding in shadows as that for a
thief of equal level. The magic user can take advantage of (or is
penalised by) dexterity and racial adjustments. This form of the spell
is only shadow enhancing, so an effort must still be made to hide. It
can be cast only on the magic user's person (a range of 0 for this
function), and the magic user must remain still and concentrate
faintly to maintain the shadows. This can only be of use where shadows
already exist. If the caster is also a thief, this spell can be used to
either give the chance of hiding as described above or add a 2% per
level (magic user's level) to the character's normal thief chances of
hiding in shadows.

#2: This version causes a number of shadowy forms to dart about up to
6" distant in a 2" square area, until the spell expires. This could be
most distracting, for it appears as though there are humanoid and
possibly animal forms moving about. These shadows cannot exist in
sunlight or a continual light, but could still be seen jumping between
areas of cover.

#3: This version creates the illusion of a number of humanoid forms,
appearing exactly as the undead shadow. Up to 1 form per level can be
made, appearing in a 10' + 1' per level square area. The magic user has
control over each form's actions. While they may look like shadows,
they are completely powerless (with the exception, perhaps, of causing
fear or uncertainty - a normal reaction for one confronted with this
situation). The magic user must maintain concentration, and even then
the maximum duration of 3 rounds per level still applies. If she or he
breaks concentration, the shadows will last 1-2 rounds longer before
fading away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skeleton (Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, The necromancer can turn one humanoid corpse into a
skeleton. The skeleton may then be controlled as per animate dead. A
mage may only have in existence through us of this spell one skeleton
per level.  The material component of this spell is a salve that
requires 50 GP and 24 uninterrupted hours to create.

Hit points of the skeleton are determined randomly. Disposing of
skeletons with insufficient hit points is possible, if expensive. When
a skeleton created by this spell is damaged, the damage cannot be
repaired.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skulkskin (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Similar to the effect of the skulk's renown ability, this spell enables
the recipient to change colour so as to blend with her or his
background; however, unlike the skulk's ability, it changes not only
the skin colour, but the colour of any items worn or carried also. The
chance of successfully hiding depends on the activity of the recipient,
as shown on the following table:

 Movement Rate	Chance of Success
 --------------	------------------
 0 (stationary)	80% + 2% per level
 Up to 1"	60% + 2% per level
 Up to 3"	40% + 2% per level
 Up to 6"	20% + 2% per level
 Up to 9"	00% + 2% per level

The recipient may attack without ruining the spell, and will surprise
on a 1-4 in 6 if successfully hidden from view. Once seen, a creature
cannot successfully hide from an observer until first moving out of its
line of sight. Note that chances to detect invisibility (DMG page 60)
apply against this spell. The material component is a bit of skin from
a colour-changing creature (such as a chameleon, troglodyte, skulk,
pseudo-dragon, etc).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small Fire Ball (Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: 1/2

This is similar to a normal Fireball spell with the following
exceptions: only one target is affected (the caster chooses the target
and the Fireball expands until the target is engulfed), damage is 1d4
per caster's level (up to a maximum of 10d4), and exposed items receive
a +2 on their saving throws. The material components for this spell are
a bit of burning incense, and any gem worth at least 5 GP; both are
consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snapshot (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Sight
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: One page
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard causes an image of whatever he sees, even
thermal images and magical auras, to appear on a sheet of parchment or
vellum (the material component of the spell).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spirit Command (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the mage to command a spirit or extra-planar
creature with a single word. The command can be uttered in a language
the creature can understand (or a language the creator could understand
if it is a summoned spirit). Spirits and creatures with 6 or more hit
dice receive a save; spells save at their caster's level (if the caster
is at least of sixth level).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time of Death (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the forensic wizard to estimate the time of death of
the recipient corpse to within 5% if the corpse has been dead no more
than one day per level of the caster, to within 20% otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tree Swipe (Alteration)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One fully grown tree
Save: None

By use of this spell, the caster will control a tree branch for the
duration of the spell.  The caster can make the branch wave, attack,
fan a small breeze, etc.  If the branch attacks, it does so as a
fighter of the same level as the caster and will do 2d6 damage.  This
spell works only on full-size trees.

The material components needed are a tree branch, a verbal "smack" and
a swing of the arm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Urlic's Unwholesome Meal (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 portions + 1 portion per level
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is used to disguise existing food or to create a completely
illusionary meal. The illusion will have full visual, thermal, touch
and smell components.

With the former usage, a bland meal can be made to appear in all
respects as a royal feast (or vice versa), and even spoiled food or
poison can seem irresistible. The serving vessels and utensils can also
be disguised. (Spoiled foods will often cause nausea, and as a general
rule, if a save versus poison is failed, a character will be
incapacitated for 3-18 rounds following a 2-16 round onset time. Allow
a 25% or greater chance (depending upon what was eaten) for more
serious poisoning lasting 4-48 hours. Both slow poison and neutralise
poison would be effective in countering these symptoms.) A saving throw
vs. spells is not given until the creature actually begins to consume
the affected meal, and this is made at -4 unless a close examination of
the food is made. If failed, the diner will believe the illusion to be
real, and will have no cause for alarm. If the save is successful, the
creature will see the meal's true form, and will be aware of the
presence of an illusion.

If a complete illusionary meal is consumed, a victim will believe that
his hunger and/or thirst has been satiated, but only for as long as the
spell duration. A saving throw is allowed, being the same as that of
the former application of the spell.

The spell requires the magic user to sprinkle a pinch of gold dust
over the food (or air) where the illusion is to be created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Werp's Unseen Escape (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a weakened version of the second level magic user spell
invisibility (q.v.) (cf. the second level magic user spell
invisibility). For the chance to detect invisibility (see Dungeon
Master's Guide, page 60), an observer is treated as five levels higher
than actual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wimbly's Wonderful Web (Conjuration, Evocation)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell, when cast, creates one strand of a very sticky web material
similar to the kind spiders use to wrap up their captured prey. When
the strand hits a creature, it immobilises them for the duration of the
spell. When the spell wears off, the web-like material ceases to be
sticky and the creature can easily escape.

During the spell, the webs require at least a 21 strength or better to
break, or an edged weapon doing at least 2 points of damage per level
of the caster. If this is not done carefully then the entangled
creature takes 3/4 full damage if the would be helper misses the webs
or half damage if he does not. The webs would take 1/4 or 1/2 damage
respectively. The webs could be more easily burned off but the
entrapped creature would take 2-7 damage from the burning webs. The
webs for this case are considered Armour Class 0

In order for the target creature to be hit, the caster attacks as a
monster of equal hit dice. Dexterity bonuses are added to the caster's
roll, if any.

If the spell misses the target creature, then an other creature behind
the target may be hit (the spell travels in a straight line out to its
maximum range or until it hits something).

The material component for this spell is some spider webs which
disappear when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wither (Necromancy)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell kills all normal vegetation within an area of 100 square
feet per level of the caster, who determines the shape of that area at
the time of casting. Trees receive a saving throw of 11, and special
plants such as treants suffer but 1d6 points of damage. The material
component is acid, sprinkled over the whole area of effect. Casting
time is exclusive of this administration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wizard Glue (Enchantment)
Level: 1
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

Wizard Glue will hold one relatively flat surface to another, a mirror
to a wall for example. The strength of the bond is 20 pounds per level
of the wizard, up to 120 pounds. Dispel Magic will end the spell, and a
strength of 10 or greater can break a 20-pound bond. A strength of 12
can break a 40-pound bond, a strength of 14 can break a 60-pound bond,
and so forth. If the item held by the glue is brittle, it may be
shattered in the separation. Honey is the material component of this
spell.
