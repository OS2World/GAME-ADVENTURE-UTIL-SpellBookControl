Acid Water (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One gallon per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns water into an acidic substance. If a creature touches
this stuff, it takes 2d4 damage. If the acid is drunk, it will take 4d4
damage. The caster can do anything in or to the substance without
taking any damage.

Ahrvar's Instant Offensiveness (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell effects any single intelligent being it is cast upon. By
intelligent being, it is meant any creature with a rudimentary form of
spoken language. This includes humans, demi-humans, humanoids,
intelligent monsters, etc.

The victim receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with
the appropriate adjustments due to Wisdom. If the victim fails his
save, the victim's speech immediately becomes offensive to all who can
understand the language the victim is using. The victim, however, only
hears what he thinks he is saying, and may become extremely curious as
to why everybody is mad at him. The words of the victim become SO
offensive, in fact, they act as a low-power Taunt spell, with those
hearing and comprehending the victim's speech making a save vs. magic
at +4, or else be consumed with a mindless desire to bash the victim's
head in. Each person within hearing of the victim will hear whatever
would be considered most offensive by them. The caster is the only one
able to hear what is actually spoken by the victim, and is thereby
immune to the taunt effect.

The components of this spell are the command word, and a subtle
pointing motion by the caster, at the target.

Ahshay's Mystic Mutable Aura (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One object or person
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a magic aura around an object similar to the one
from Nystul's Magic Aura. However, it hides not the magic property, but
the alignment of the target. The caster can specify which alignment he
wants the object to radiate as well as the strength of the radiation.
The higher the level of the caster the more radical alignment he could
place on the object or person. Note that this aura does not change the
alignment (if present) of a person or object.

This spell foils such spells as Detect Good/Evil, a paladins Detect
Evil ability and the spell Know Alignment. It does not change the
effect of the Protection from Good/Evil spells. Note that the priest
version of True Sight or a gem of seeing will see through this spell.
If the object or person acts in a different way than is indicated by
the aura, other people will get a disbelieve check. A mage with the
true sight spell will now get a true reading off a detect evil.

The material component of this spell is a sheet of thin silk in an
appropriate colour to the alignment being cast. It is consumed
completely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Moonlight (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an area of soft blue-grey light, apparently coming
downwards from above. This light effectively washes out all colour, but
clear vision is certainly possible within the area of effect. Vision is
also possible out to 10 yards beyond the spell's radius, but such
vision is dim and shadowy at best. The moonlight does not interfere in
any way with infravision, but the nature of the light is such that
creatures adversely affected by bright light suffer only half the
normal penalties when within the Moonlight and none when within its
shadowy fringes. The Moonlight spell may be centered on the caster, in
which case it moves with him. Otherwise, the spell must be cast on an
area and is stationary. The material component of this spell is a
moonstone that has been exposed to actual moonlight for a full night.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Rainbow Beam (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell draws upon the power of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of
Radiance and brings forth a beam of pure light. The colour of the light
making up the beam is normally randomly determined by a roll of a d8.
However, the caster has a chance equal to 5% per level of being able to
select the colour of the beam (the caster may not select a multi-hued
beam. Such occurs only as the result of an aberration in the magic).
The colours of the beams are as follows:

 1	red (cold)		6	indigo (holy water)
 2	orange (heat)		7	violet (force)
 3	yellow (acid)		8	multi-hued beam -
 4	green (poison)			roll twice ignoring 8's
 5	blue (electrical)

The beam does a base of 2d6, plus an additional point of damage for
each level of the caster (e.g. a 7th level caster would inflict 9-19
(2d6+7) points of damage). Any creature resistant to the attack form
indicated by the colour of the beam takes NO damage, while a creature
vulnerable to the specific attack form (such as heat vs. a yeti) will
suffer double damage. A saving throw indicates that the beam has
missed and the intended victim is unaffected. Note that the beam may
hit a target other than the one intended. Once the beam hits a solid
object, it stops, even if that object is transparent. Any creature
suffering damage from the spell must make item saving throws if
appropriate. The material component of the spell is a small clear gem
or crystal prism worth at least 50 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Spark Shower (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' x 20' long x 10' base wedge shape
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster extends his arms and speaks the spell, and a sheet of
sizzling purple sparks shoots forth from the caster's hands. These
sparks cause 1d4 electrical damage per three levels of the caster,
rounded up, to a maximum of 5d4. Those wielding metal weapons (swords,
etc.) or wearing partially metal armour (ring, scale, chain) save at -2
and suffer +1 point of damage per die. Those wearing full metal armour
(splint, banded, plate, etc.) save at -4 and suffer double damage. The
material component is a bit of fur, glass, and copper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Star Gaze (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a blazing white sheet of light to issue from the
caster's eyes. This sheet will envelop a number of creatures based on
the caster's level. Those who fail a save vs. petrification will be
blinded for a full turn. Those who do save are merely dazzled (-2 on
to hit and AC) for 1 round, having looked away just in time. Dark
dependent creatures such as drow and gray dwarves save at a -4 vs.
this spell, and the duration of its effects are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Starblades (Conjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10' + 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per 3 levels maximum
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates one magical star-shaped bladed weapon for each three
levels of the caster, up to a maximum of seven. The caster may then
throw these as weapons, out to the spell's maximum range. They are
treated as Slashing weapons with respect to effectiveness vs. armour,
and the caster's to hit rolls with them are at +3, in addition to any
bonus for high dexterity. Each Starblade that strikes causes 2d4
damage, +2 vs. creatures with powers drawing on the negative material
plane or plane of shadow. The material component is a small silver
star.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambient Light (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 2" radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is in many ways similar to the first level spell Light
(q.v.). With an Ambient Light spell, while there is a centre for its
sphere of effect, there is no point of light at this centre -- the
intensity of the light is consistent throughout the entire globe. The
light is even behind objects or walls, in a closed chest, in fact,
everywhere in the area of effect. Therefore, absolutely no shadows
exist. The spell has a number of interesting effects because of this;
for example, if cast in a hallway, the light would extend through a
door or wall into an adjacent room (or even into secret tunnels below
the hall) up to the full area of effect. Just beyond the 2" radius
globe, reflected light from the actual area of affect lights up 5'
further. This is much dimmer than the globe, is very shadowy (if there
is something to cast one), and fades off into complete darkness
(assuming, of course, the area would be dark without this spell). One
obvious advantage of the spell is to make hiding in shadows impossible
within the area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annoyance (Illusion)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This is a more powerful version of the first level spell Minor
Annoyance (q.v.), in that it creates the illusion of a bumblebee flying
into the victim's ear. The victim only gets one saving throw; if
successful, the annoyance lasts for only one round. The spell's effects
start at the beginning of the next round, just like Minor Annoyance.

The material component of this spell is a dead insect. If an actual
dead bumblebee is used, the victim's saving throw is made at -2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azalldam's Fabricated Boat (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Azalldam's Fabricated Bridge except it shapes
a boat from the conjured shadows instead of a bridge. The caster may
create a boat of 50 square feet per level (up to a maximum of 1000
square feet). The boat will support 100 pounds per level of the caster;
any additional weight will cause the boat to capsize. The spell will
last 1 turn for each level of the caster, or until the caster ends it.

Similar to the Fabricated Bridge spell, the boat may not be
disbelieved, but may be dispelled.

The material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of a
boat; this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigby's Groping Fingers (Conjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to "grope" his target. This spell is
usually used by mischievous apprentices in bars and such... have fun!
(gee, I don't know if I'm hitting a copyright problem by using the name
"Bigby" in here but it just seems the most appropriate name to use, and
for all I care, if TSR wishes to claim this silly spell as their own,
so be it).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Byen's Arrow (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round per arrow
Area of Effect: One arrow per 2 levels
Saving Throw: None

Several decades past, Byen, the famed assassin/illusionist of the City
of Yorkad, created this spell so as to be able to execute certain
"assassinations" which would seem completely real but in which the
victim would (hopefully) not be killed. Byen's Arrow creates a very
powerful illusion that is modelled exactly after an actual arrow. The
caster must take a real arrow, of fine quality, and spend one entire
round chanting and weaving her or his hands along the edge of the
arrow. To complete the casting, the caster must prick her or his finger
with a splinter of wood and smear it upon the arrowhead. The arrow is
then actually replaced by an illusion, that has full visual, audible,
tactile, thermal, and olfactory components. An attempt to disbelieve
can be made, but the save is made a -2 DM (or +2 if informed of the
illusion); however, in most circumstances, there will be no reason to
suspect anything is amiss. The magic user can "enchant" up to 1 arrow
for every two levels she or he possesses, each arrow taking one round
of preparation.

The arrows must be shot in a normal manner (i.e. the magic user must
have someone of a class able to make use make use of a bow to shoot
them). Such a user will in no way suspect that the arrows are
illusionary from just examining them. If these arrows hit a target, the
illusion continues so that the target will bleed illusionary blood, an
will feel illusionary pain. Unless the victim for some reason attempted
to disbelieve and this attempt was successful, the victim will take the
full 1-6 damage from the arrow, plus any applicable bonuses for
strength, specialisation, a magic bow, etc. Only 25% of this damage is
actual, but even after the illusion fades (which happens in 5 rounds +
1 round per level after being hit) the victim will still suffer form
shock and a loss in confidence and composure. Hit points lost because
of these arrows that were not part of actual damage will be recovered
at a rate of 1 HP per round of rest or 1 HP per turn of even mild
activity, but not at all for strenuous activity. Creatures brought
below zero HP because of this illusionary damage will be unconscious
and must make a system shock survival roll of else die of shock, losing
1 HP per round until reaching -10, unless they receive aid. Even
creatures that can be hit by only by silver, iron or magical weapons
will suffer from all the above effects unless they have some special
resistance to illusions (or have reason to be suspicious and
disbelieve).

Note that Byen's Arrow will work on light and heavy quarrels of high
quality as well as on arrows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cause of Death (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell the forensic wizard can determine if the corpse has
received damage from any of the causes listed in the table below, and
which cause actually reduced him to zero hit points. This spell
involves dissection of the corpse, and the material components are a
magnifying glass and a set of scalpels. These are not expended by the
casting.

 Cause			Notes and secondary information
 ------------------	--------------------------------------------
 Exposure		exposure to cold, fire, heat, or lightning;
 			drowning
 Falling or hanging	height fallen from
 Disease or old age	organs affected, parasites involved
 Magic			applies only to magic missile or necromantic
 			effects
 Wound			wound inflicted by bludgeoning, piercing, or
 			slashing

The DM may introduce a chance of failure if the body is greatly
decomposed, and he might give false information based on nature of the
trauma. A corpse swatted by a dragon's tail, for example, might show
the same indications as one which fell from a great height, and a
poisoned corpse usually looks like one which died of disease. The
prudent forensic wizard always detects poison just to be sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheffield's Major Feast (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 4 people fed per level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast into a large pot or onto an appropriate number
of plates it brings into being enough food to feed four per level of
the caster for one meal. The food is nourishing and filling, the drink
is cool and refreshing. The food may not taste the best in the world
but it certainly fills the cracks. It also makes, when chilled and
rewarmed, exceptional leftovers.

This spell requires a handful of rice which is cooked over a low boil
while the caster mutters "cooks in just 5 minutes."

The spell was created by a magic user whose abilities as a chef far
surpassed those of his spell casting. He is known far and wide as a
chef of great skill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Circle of Power (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell allows a group of mages to work in conjunction to
create a special area of effect (the circle) into which one mage (or
possibly two) may enter and have their working level of experience
increased. A minimum of four mages is required to initiate the spell,
and the spell must be cast by the mages of the circle, not read or used
from any device.

First, the mages form a circle and begin casting the spell. The spells
from each mage must then synchronise into a rhythmic chanting effect.
This means that it will take as many rounds as the highest level member
of the circle to make the circle synchronise and become operative. From
that point on, a mage may enter the circle and have his working level
of experience increased by the total combined levels of the circle
spellcasters minus one level for each member of the circle. Once
entered, the central mage may rest and study as a higher level mage,
but may not use new spell levels, just the higher memorisation
capabilities, spell range, duration increases, etc. If the total number
of levels bestowed reaches 20, another mage may step into the circle
and divide the increased level benefits between himself and the first
mage with all odd remaining levels becoming useless and therefore
ignored.

Any members of the circle who are injured immediately fall away from
the circle's synchronisation and the central mage(s) lose(s) the
benefits of that member's levels one turn later. New mages may join
into the circle at any time (taking an equal number of rounds as their
experience level to synchronise with the circle), though, and since the
effects of being in a circle will not wear off for one full turn other
circles may be formed which the mage may enter to retain his current
working level (or increase of decrease it according to the levels of
the new circle).

Members of the circle may chant (from the synchronisation point) for a
period of turns equal to the combination of their intelligence and
constitution scores divided by two and then added to their current
experience level. The circle members (but not the central mages) gain a
magic resistance to any attacks against the circle which would silence
the spell equal to the total experience levels of the circle members.

The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

Cloud Walk (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creatures touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the recipient to walk on any form of fog, cloud, or
smoke as if it were solid. The recipient may move at normal movement
rate, plus the movement rate of the smoke (thus a rising column of
smoke from a fire might carry the recipient up at 12 movement rate).
The smoke must be reasonably thick, reducing visibility
significantly... This spell will not allow walking on fine mist. The
material component is a hair from a nightmare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dancing Fire Light (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Save: 1/2

This spell - except as noted - is the same as Dancing Light (out of
TSR's Player's Handbook). The lights are orange-like in colour and give
off heat. If the caster concentrates on the balls, he can have them
attack doing 1-3 points of damage per ball (4 balls maximum). All the
balls must attack the same target in any given round. Optionally, the
caster can form one mass that looks like a fire elemental and can
attack once per round and does 3-9 points of damage. The heat can set
fire to flammables.

The material components needed are a piece of flint and either a bit of
phosphorus or withwood.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Death Armour (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any creature who touches the caster with
exposed flesh (to cast a spell, for example) will suffer 1d8 points of
damage. The spell will not protect the necromancer from damage, nor
does it have any effect on an armed opponent, but it will affect
undead, and the death master adds one point to damage inflicted with
his bare hands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Chaos (Divination) Reversible
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6"
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" wide path
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar in all respects to the second level mage spell
Detect Evil/Good (q.v.), except that the mage is detecting for
Chaos/Law.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Magic II (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 6" + 2" per level path, 2" wide
Save: None

This spell is just like TSR's Detect Magic spell except it is more
sensitive, has a longer range (6"+1" per level for the TSR version),
and the caster will be able to determine accurately what kind of magic
(alteration, divination, conjuration, etc.) is in effect if the magic
is within 6" + 1" per level. This spell will not blind, hurt, or ...
someone if in an area of extreme magic, the caster will simply know
that stronger magic is in effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Phase (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster can see and perceive any creature
that is out of or in a different phase than that of the caster. This
means that the caster will see clearly such creatures with special
defenses as displacement, blinking, duo-dimension, astral, or
etherealness and those who can shift out of phase, such as a phase
spider. Furthermore, if the caster has means to attack such creatures,
he will have none of the ill effects that normally occur when trying to
attack (i.e. the caster would know the exact location of a displacer
beast, or where the phase spider is etc.). The information cannot be
communicated to his fellows by words.

The material component of this spell requires a lens of calcite crystal
which must be viewed through for the spell to have effect. It does not
disappear at the end of the spell.

Some Mages have made spectacles of calcite crystal so they would have
there hands free to do other things after casting the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detect Spirit (Divination) Reversible
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: None

Detects the presence of a soul spirit or mentality in any body or
object (enchanted swords, etc.), and whether or not the mind
controlling the body is its "native". Thus, it will not detect charming
or hypnosis but will detect possession. Only the fact of a mind is
detected, not its nature. If it is cast on a normally invisible spirit
(such as an Invisible Stalker or Unseen Servant), the caster can see
the creature as a visible force for one turn per level. The reverse,
Obscure Spirit, has a range of touch and conceals a single mind or
spirit from detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disease (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Similar to spells such as Blindness and Deafness, a Disease spell will
cause its target to believe that she or he has contracted a real
(natural) disease. Even though the spell affects the mind, the victim
believes so strongly in the disease that boils, pains and any other
symptoms normally associated with the affliction will be imagined,
putting the individuals health under considerable stress.

If the target has recently been in a situation where contracting a
disease is quite likely (such as living in filthy surroundings, falling
into sewage or garbage heaps, attacks from giant rats or oygtugs,
etc.), a saving throw is made at a penalty of -4; on the other hand, if
a character has recently had a Cure Disease cast upon herself or
himself, is immune to normal diseases, or has some other strong reason
to believe that she or he could not possibly have contracted a disease,
then a saving throw at +4 or higher (probably +8 if normally immune) is
allowed.

Once the spell takes effect, it is permanent until the inflicted
receives a Dispel Illusion. The disease is determined randomly from
the table in the DMG, with the full effects described inflicting the
target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dispel Silence (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell automatically dispels any magical silence within
its area of effect. Furthermore, no silence spell will have effect
within the area of effect for the duration of the spell.

The casting of this spell requires a small silver bell, chime, or gong,
which must be struck twice, at the end of each segment of casting. The
device must be worth at least 50 GP, and is consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dreamoore's Explosive Missile (Alteration/Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell actually has two variations. The first produces a special
dart which the magic-user hurls toward its target. The dart has a +3
"to hit" bonus at 10' or less, +2 at 20', and +1 at 30'. A successful
hit does 3-6 damage points +1 hit point per caster's hit die. The
second version enchants an ordinary arrow or quarrel, making it magical
for hitting purposes, and delivering double normal damage +1 hit point
per caster's level.

Both versions also have a residual blast radius, inflicting 2d4 damage,
or 1d4 on a save vs. magic. Any item struck directly by an explosive
missile must save vs. crushing blow to avoid damage. The material
components are sulfur, diamond dust, and the appropriate missile being
enchanted. The first version requires a 10 GP silver dart as it's
missile. The explosive missile must be used within three rounds of
creation, otherwise it detonates and does damage to those immediately
around it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dreamoore's War Disk (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The war disk is a small hand hurled missile which the magic-user throws
toward its target. It's "to hit" bonus is +3 at less than 2", +2 from
2" - 4", and +1 from 4" - 6". The caster must declare which version he
is casting prior to the throw. The first type hits only once for 1d4
base damage + 1 hit point per level of the caster. The second may be
thrown once per round for 1d4 + 1 point of damage per successful hit
and automatically returns at the end of the round. Its duration is one
round per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duck! (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 (but takes up the entire round - see below)
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the caster helps the defence out on himself or another
creature. If the caster sees an attack coming, the caster can cause
the creature to be suddenly moved out of the way so as to cause the
attack to miss. This will only work against body (claws, bit, etc.)
or hand held weapons. The creature that has been moved must then take
5 segments readjusting his position before it can attack again.

The caster must prepare for this spell, and must declare at the end of
the previous round that he is casting this spell. The caster then
waits until the monster attacks, and throws the spell.

Creatures that have never had this done to them before must make a save
vs. petrification or be stunned for 2 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dumbness (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes the recipient creature to become completely dumb,
believing that she or he is unable to speak by means of voice in any
way (cf. Blindness, Deafness). This effect can only be removed by
Dispel Illusion, or by the will of the caster, and is permanent until
such time. The victim does get a saving throw verses spell to avoid the
effect. Note: this spell could be very effective against creatures such
as androsphinxes, dragonnes and harpies.

Dust Warriors (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" long square
Saving Throw: None

The material component for this spell is a full set of teeth from a
man-sized or larger carnivore which must be cast on an area of earth,
rock, raw stone, sand or gravel as the spell is cast. The spell
generates 1 skeleton + 1 per 2 levels which rise from the area. They
will fight for the caster until they are turned or destroyed, the
caster is slain, rendered unconscious or moves out of spell range of
the group, or the magic is dispelled. They last only while there is
someone to attack (including each other, if necessary) - any round in
which there are no targets available the skeletons will fade back into
dust.

If dragon's teeth are used as the material component, each skeleton
will have bonus hit points equal to the age category of the dragon
(count 4 HP = 1 HD for turning and attack purposes). Furthermore, they
will be immune to the attack type of the dragon's breath weapon. [ed.
note: we use second edition, so dragon's teeth aren't too easy to come
by]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expose Magic (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell will inform the caster of all of the details of a single
spell cast within one round per level - including the destination of a
teleport, the target of a charm spell, the name of a spell without
obvious effect, etc. The spell does not invalidate illusion magic - the
spell will return an answer consistent with the illusion (i.e. that a
Fireball was cast rather than a Spectral Forces) unless the caster has
already disbelieved successfully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exterminate II (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None or special

Exterminate negates Call Insect, protects one person against Insect
Plague, and gives +6 on saves vs. Summon Insects. Dispel Magic requires
a mage of twice the caster's level. Magic resistance applies only to
the creature touched.

To negate this spell, both victim and insects have to make their saves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fellstar's Flamehand (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When cast, this spell causes the caster's hands to glow with a soft red
light; if the caster scores a hit in combat, his hand will discharge a
sheet of flames that will engulf the target. The victim suffers damage
equal to 1d10 + 1 per level of the caster (a successful save vs. spell
reduces the damage by one half). This spell may be used twice per
casting (once for each hand); both charges must be used within 5 rounds
plus 1 round per two levels of the caster; after this time, any
remaining charges are lost. Two attacks may not be made in the same
round unless the wizard is normally capable of doing so; in this case,
two separate "to hit" rolls must be made, and each suffers a -2
penalty.

The flames from this spell will ignite any combustible material; these
flames may be extinguished the following round, if no other action is
taken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greysky's Improved Missile (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One or more creatures
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as the first level magic user spell
magic missile except for two changes: (1) the area of effect - everyone
in spell range could possibly be hit with 1 or more missiles - and (2)
the number of missiles that can be fired by the caster - for every 3
levels of experience, the caster can fire two magic missiles (i.e.
level 1-3: 2 missiles, level 4-6: 4 missiles, level 7-9: 6 missiles,
etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guilda's Sneakabout Light (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Creates a dim, floating light of variable intensity that follows the
caster. At its brightest, it is enough to read with good eyesight, and
it can be extinguished and restored at will during the duration. No
light produced by the spell escapes the 5' radius, preventing the caster
from being given away by his light--so this spell is ideal for
thieves. Note that background light penetrates the area of effect
freely, so the caster is in no way concealed by this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hand of Ithiqua (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

A target of the Hand of Ithiqua, failing to save vs. magic will be
pinned to the ground by an invisible force. The force is illusionary,
but will seem completely real to the victim, so that she or he will be
unable to move. The victim will be pinned to the ground at a location
of the magic user's choice, and despite any struggling will have a
movement of 0 regardless of strength. The subject will be very prone,
+4 to be hit (with no AC adjustment for dexterity) and -4 to attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heat Feet (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes the affected creatures' footgear to become very hot,
blistering the victim's feet. Because of this, the target fights with a
-2 to hit, a +2 penalty to it's armour class, loses any dexterity
bonuses, and moves at 5/6 of it's normal speed. The reduction in
movement rate lasts until the blisters have healed. Creatures that are
immune to fire don't suffer any of these effects. Flammable footgear
must save vs. normal fire or be ruined; footgear that saves is merely a
bit charred.

Alternatively, this spell can be used to counter the effects of natural
cold. In this mode, the spell will keep the affected creatures' feet
comfortably warm for 1 turn per level of the caster, even in snow or
ice.

The material components for this spell are 2 leaves of stinging nettle
and, of course, footgear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imitation (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar in nature to Change Self (q.v.), but allows the
magic user to assume the form of a specific creature. There is,
however, a chance that the form will not be accurately imitated, with
some inconsistency or fault being noticed by the observer(s). The
chance of an observer detecting this ruse is as follows:

 Observers Familiarity	Base Chance of	Modifier for
 With Assumed Form	Detection	Caster's Familiarity
 ---------------------	--------------	--------------------
 Very well known	25 %		- 5 %
 Seen often		15 %		+ 0 %
 Seen occasionally	10 %		+10 %
 Seen once		5 %		+20 %
 Never seen		0 % *		Not applicable

* This is also the chance of a creature recognising a non-specific form
as a false one.

 Additional Modifiers:
 + 5% per level of the viewer
 - 5% per level of the magic user
 +20% if listener attempts to determine authenticity
 +10% if only seen occasionally
 + 5% if seen once or never seen
 - 1% per one foot of distance

The chance of detection should be rolled upon initial contact, once for
every three turns of exposure or one turn of direct conversation, and
once for an attempt to determine authenticity. The spell may not be
immediately recognised as an illusion, even if a fault is detected, for
it could be seen as a disguise or a physical change (as with a
doppleganger). Note that strong physical contact could reveal the
spell, as the illusion is only visual. Also, unless a Voice spell is
also used, observers could become very suspicious. The size of the
alteration can be 50% of actual. Note that the change is entirely
illusionary (unlike Alter Self) -- no actual physical properties are
gained whatsoever and special abilities (gaze attacks, horror effects,
etc.) cannot be reproduced so as to have these special effects.

Improved Detect Magic (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' wide path, 300 yards long
Saving Throw: None

This spell acts like Detect Magic except it works out to hundreds of
yards range.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Improved Identify (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One item per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as Identify except that the caster gets a 20%
per level chance of identifying the item and gets a +2 on any saves
versus a cursed item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inaudibility (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell completely masks all sounds made by the recipient. These
include sounds such as breathing, talking, as well as sounds made when
the recipient strikes another object, in fact, any object held by the
recipient will also likewise be silenced.

Object thrown, dropped, or knocked over by the recipient will not be
silenced by the spell, as they are not in contact with the inaudible
creature.

An unwilling creature is allowed to make a saving throw against this
spell, and it is a great way to silence spell casters (unless they have
the spell vocalise).

The material component for this spell is a piece of cotton.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last Experience (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the forensic wizard re-lives the last minute of the
recipient's life. If the victim was conscious during this minute, the
wizard must make a system shock check or be knocked out for 1d4 hours.
The material components are a convex lens and a scalpel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lightservant (Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 3" radius around caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a variation of the first-level magic-user spell Unseen
Servant. The servant created by this spell is visible as a vaguely
manlike form of glowing light, and is slightly stronger, being able to
lift 3000 GP weight and taking 8 hit points of magical damage to
destroy. The light provided by the servant is enough to allow normal
vision in a 1" radius around the servant. Except as noted above, and
that the material components of this spell are a live firefly and a
piece of thread, this spell behaves as Unseen Servant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Mike's Projection (Conjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 1/2 hour per level maximum
Casting time: 2
Area of Effect: One 100 feet high, 100-foot radius cylinder
Saving Throw: None

For this spell to take effect, the mage makes a cone out of a sheet of
parchment and places inside it one copper coin for each 5 minutes of
spell effect. The magic words are chanted and the parchment cone
crumpled and released. When the parchment cone is crumpled, it is
replaced by a 4 inch diameter, black, sphere which remains at its
location of creation for the duration of the spell.

The black sphere is the center of a cylinder 10 feet high with a
10-foot radius. Any sound within the cylinder is projected into a
surrounding cylinder which is 100 feet high and has a 100-foot radius.
The black sphere is also the center of this cylinder.

Anyone within the 100 foot cylinder hears sounds as if they were in a
corresponding location within the 10 foot cylinder.

This spell was created my Michael Verilait, a mage who was usually
frustrated at not being able to hear what was happening on stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malta's Pattern Creation (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can create a pattern for use with the spell
Malta's Pattern Transport. The Pattern can be any image with any
colours, but it must include a circle which forms the outer edge. The
Pattern can be any inch radius, but the cost of making the Pattern is
dependent on the materials used - so bigger Patterns cost more. The
Pattern can be woven into cloth, painted onto cloth or a hard surface,
or inlaid into a hard surface. The Pattern must be at least one yard in
diameter with no maximum size. The cost to make a Pattern is equal to
the square yards of the Pattern times the amount below:

 Material		Cost		Time		Save
 ----------------	--------	--------	----
 Painted on Cloth	5 Silver	1 hour		15
 Woven into Cloth	1 Gold		10 hours	12
 Woven into Rug		2 Gold		15 hours	10
 Painted on Wood	1 Gold		3 hours		10
 Painted on Stone	2 Gold		4 hours		8
 Inlaid in Wood		3 Gold		12 hours	5
 Inlaid in Stone	5 Gold		16 hours	2

Patterns cannot be repaired, they must be remade completely. Patterns
can be moved (assuming the material can be moved as one unit) without
damage. The saving throw listed is the save the Pattern must make when
used for transport (see Malta's Pattern Transport for details) - the
material saves normally for any other damaging situation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malta's Pattern Image (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One Pattern
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can imprint the size and image of an
undamaged Pattern. This imprinted image can later be used by the caster
to create a matching Pattern of his own. The imprinted image can be
recalled by the caster for up to one month per caster's level (at
casting time). If this time is exceeded, or the caster creates a
matching Pattern (even if different size), then the imprinted image is
dispelled. This spell is necessary to create an exact size matching
Pattern if the original Pattern is not present for the creation of the
matching Pattern. The caster can have up to one imprinted image/size
per level at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mangar's Bloodfire (Evocation, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2 (check each round)

This spell engulfs a creature with blue fire that burns for 1d4 HP per
3 caster levels (or fraction thereof) on round 1, then loses 1d4 per
round until it goes out. The flames do not ignite flammable objects,
they just hurt creatures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memorise Song (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to memorise the next song he hears. From
then on, the caster can sing and play the song exactly as he heard it,
without worrying about forgetting verses or notes later on in life.

This is especially useful for traveling minstrels, who must remember
someone else's songs for a long time in order to sing them (in other
words, "spread the news") in far away lands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mimicry (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the first level magic user spell Minor
Mimicry (q.v.). However, the spell continues even after a form is
dispelled by movement, and once the spell recipient again becomes
stationary, she or he can be concealed by a new form (again chosen by
the magic user). Therefore, the only ways the spell would end are an
end to concentration by the magic user or the spell recipient passing
beyond 1" range per level. If the casters' concentration is ended, any
illusionary form will last 5 rounds + 1 round per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noise Filter (Illusion)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5-foot per level radius
Saving Throw: Special

All creatures within the area effect at the time of casting will have
their hearing muted - they will not hear anything unless they have some
other confirmation of its existence. Thus, you can only hear people
speak if you can see their face or know precisely what they will say;
background noise will continue if you know it should be there but
sudden noises from the next room will not be heard, etc. Once a
creature notices or becomes suspicious of the effect (by turning around
and seeing a large pile of broken crockery they did not hear break, for
example), it will automatically be dispelled with respect to that
creature. The material component is a pair of blinders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow (Enchantment)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When cast, Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow minorly enchants one missile
weapon (i.e. sling stone, arrow, quarrel, etc.) to automatically hit
any target normally within the weapon's range. Effective with "called
shots", and situations of that nature. The missile's enchantment does
normal damage as it were an unaided hit of the same nature. The
enchantment instantly wears off upon the arrival at the missile's
destination.

Petition (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is used to alert an extra-planar being that the caster
wishes to contact it. The spell does not allow further communication
(though the extra-planar being may then contact the caster through
other magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plane Source (Divination) Reversible
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature or item
Saving Throw: Negates

Reveals the Plane of origin of any one creature, object or magical
phenomenon in spell range, or the Plane reachable by the closest gate
or dimensional nexus point. Hostile or unwilling creatures save vs.
spells to avoid their origins being divined. The reverse obscures
detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pobithakor's Pacifier (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 second
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used when the caster is the subject of the Pobithakor's
placer spell. What this spell does is disrupts the energies and allows
the caster a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. There is
enough time when the caster is being pulled through to cast this
spell.

The verbal component varies, but usually sounds something like "not
tonight, I have a headache" or "not on the first date".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection from Enchantment (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell is partially immune to magical forms of
sleep, charm, and fear. He automatically receives a saving throw even
if one is not ordinarily permitted, and if one is permitted, he saves
at +4. Note that this spell will not free the recipient from any
enchantment already in force, nor will it protect him from natural
drowsiness or feminine guile. Also note that protection extends only to
actual charm spells, such as charm person or charm monster, not to
enchantment/charm spells as a class. The material component is a lapis
lazuli or more potent stone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resist Cold (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the first level
clerical spell Resist Cold (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, and Hold spells,
but it does not negate paralysis already in effect. The material
component is a feather and an infusion of tea and ginger (to be
consumed by the recipient).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reveal Owner (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One item
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell receives a mental impression of the most
recent owner or owners of the recipient object. An "owner" is defined
as an intelligent entity who was in direct physical contact (i.e., no
gloves) with the object one hour, or who had the object upon his person
for 24 hours. These time requirements may be divided by the caster's
level, and for every 4 levels of the caster, one previous owner can be
identified. Thus an eighth level wizard, for example, could determine
the last two owners who carried the object for at least 3 hours each.

The information gained is sufficient that the wizard will recognise the
owner on sight, and he can uniquely specify the owner for the purpose
of such spells as legend lore. The material component of this spell is
a handful of dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarius' Golden Squares of Protection (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One floating 2' long square plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering square plates of force which move
around the caster in a constant motion, attempting to deflect missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
not altered by the spell, but any successful physical attack (less
boulders, ballista, or attacks similar to a dragon's belly flop
maneuver) will be deflected if the mage successfully saves versus
breath weapons. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective
strength of 19 or greater require a saving throw versus spells to
deflect.

Each plate is able to sustain 4 hit points of damage before disrupting,
so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to disrupt a
square (chosen randomly) the square will remain active. For every 5
squares active, the effects of breath weapons directed at the caster
will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with 1 hit point damage
per die being the maximum reduction allowable. Though, unless the
breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
square it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of squares in the
process.

While the squares orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for every
square active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including spells. The
mage may create fewer squares than the maximum possible. The material
component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for every square
created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they disappear and
are replaced by the floating squares.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secret Torch (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns
Casting Time: 1 round per torch
Area of effect: One torch per 2 levels
Saving Throw: None

This spell lights one or more ordinary torches. The flames will,
however, be cold and dark, shedding no ordinary light. The wielder of
the torch will however be able to see by the torch, as if it was an
ordinary torch, as long as he has it in his hand. Only one person can
benefit from the torch at a given time: if two or more persons touch
it, no-one will benefit. The wielder must hold it in his bare hand if he
wants to see by it, and the flames will seem warm to him. The torch can
be put aside or handed over, as an ordinary torch would be, but can not
set fire to anything. It can be extinguished by any normal means, e.g.
water or very strong winds. The torch will slowly smoulder and burn
out, as an ordinary torch would.

The material components are the torch(es) to be lit, and a small
portion of oil with rare herbs, which the torches are rubbed with (3
GP's worth per torch). In addition, the spellcaster must have access to
a source of fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shield II (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Save: None

This spell creates an invisible barrier in a hemisphere around the
caster. This barrier provides the equivalent protection of:

 AC. 0	vs. hand thrown objects (daggers, dart, throwing axes, etc.);
 AC. 1	vs. device propelled (arrows, bolts, etc.);
 AC. 2	vs. everything else.

Against magic the caster gains +1 to saves vs. things that are
physically damaging, negates magic missiles, and decreases spell damage
by 1 point per level.

Shocksphere (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 2" diameter sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a small ball of crackly blue light which expands
outwards when it contacts a solid object, hits its target, reaches its
maximum range or it reaches the point where the caster wishes it to
expand. When it does expand, a large amount of electrical energy is
given off, small lightning bolts arc from object to object inside the
sphere and blue light is given off in a 6" diameter sphere. All
creatures within the area of effect must make a save vs. spells or take
1-3 points of damage per level of the caster (a successful save means
damage is halved). If a particular creature was targeted for the spell
then they take 1-4 damage per level of the caster and their saving
throw is made at a -2.

If the area in which the Shocksphere expands is not circular then the
sphere will expand an conform to the volume it can occupy. The
Shocksphere covers a volume of 4200 cubic feet.

If a creature fails its saving throw vs. spell then all of his items
must make a saving throw vs. lightning or be destroyed.

Otherwise this spell is similar to a Fireball spell in many respects.
The material components for the spell is a small chunk of dried flesh
from an electric eel or any other creature that uses electricity for an
attack.

Sillvatar's Silver Lining (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One melee weapon, 2 arrows or 2 bolts
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used to temporarily enchant a weapon to give it the
properties of a silver weapon. In order for this spell to work, the
caster must have 1 silver piece per pound of the weapon to be
enchanted. When the spell is cast, the weapon is held in one hand, and
the silver pieces in the other; the two are then touched together, and
the blade "absorbs" the silver pieces. For the duration of the spell,
or until it is dispelled, the weapon will have all the properties of a
silver weapon (i.e. it may be used to hit creatures who are normally
harmed only by silver weapons). If one looks closely at the weapon, a
silver glint will be seen upon its edge.

This spell will only enchant slashing or piercing weapons; blunt
weapons are not affected by this spell. One melee weapon, or up to two
arrows or bolts may be enchanted per casting of this spell.

The only components for this spell are the weapon and the silver
pieces; the silver pieces are lost, but the weapon is unharmed.

Sonic Barrier (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an invisible, spherical barrier through which sound
cannot pass. The barrier remains centered on the caster, enabling an
assault group to move in absolute silence without giving up
inter-communication. However, sound cannot pass into the barrier
either, making the party deaf for the duration. The material component
is a glass globe.

Sonoric's Lodestone (Divination)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster is able to determine the general direction
of a creature within the one mile, per every three levels of the
caster (i.e. two mile range at fourth level, three at seventh, etc.).
This direction sense last for the duration of the spell, regardless of
the movement of the caster, or the creature. If the distance between
the caster and the target should exceed the maximum range (target
teleports, etc.), the spell is broken.

If the caster comes within three feet of the object of the spell, he
gets a sharp headache. If the caster actually touches the object of the
spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of this spell is some item which was in contact
with the creature, up to the caster's level in turns previously.

Spider Climb II (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the creature can walk on any surface and not slip. The
creature can walk on walls, ceilings, ice, etc. and not slip or slide
(feet are like suction cups to the surface). The creature can also
have one jump like the spell jump from TSR's books (this is only one
jump, not three like the first level spell gives).

The jump does not include a safe landing, but by using this spell, the
creature can jump up on a wall and start climbing, or climb up some
wall and jump to a different wall.

The material components needed are: a piece of gum (tree sap, or some
type of sticky substance) and a small jumping spider (a grass hopper
leg and a piece of spider webbing can be used as a substitute).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summon Undead (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell causes 3 HD of undead per 2 levels of the caster to appear
within range. They will obey his commands until slain, dispelled, or
the spell ends. The wizard may mix and match types as long as he does
not exceed his HD allotment.

The necromancer cannot summon a creature of more HD than his level.
Treat a +3 or better bonus to HD as the next die up, so a wight is
worth 5 HD and a wraith is 6, a mummy 7, spectre 8, and a vampire (the
toughest undead that can be summoned) is worth 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transcribe Song (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One piece of paper
Saving Throw: None

This spell converts sound waves from a song currently being played
within hearing range of the bard to musical notation onto a piece of
paper the bard has in his possession. It will transcribe up to one
round's worth of music into the musical notation most familiar to the
bard.

This spell is useful for keeping records of new songs, or for keeping
track of songs the bard is worried about forgetting. It does not work
well for conversations, since it does not transcribe the words of
songs, only the noted of the song itself.

The material components for this spell are a piece of paper or
parchment, two ounces of good ink, and a grain of diamond dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trosli's Spontaneous Defenestration (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates an illusion of a window in a wall near the subject.
The subject must save vs. spells or be seized by an irresistible
compulsion to leap through the supposed window, bonking his head on the
wall and taking 1-4 points of damage per level of the caster and being
stunned for one round. Non-intelligent creatures are immune to this
spell, and creatures immune to blunt weapons, or unable to perform
leaping actions, take no damage. The material component is a small
pane of glass, which is consumed in casting.

This spell was researched by the gnomish illusionist/thief Trosli
Kenderkin, a notorious trickster who once took out five gnolls (at
first level) with a bag of marbles and a dagger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Veschiul's Shadowbolt (Evocation)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 12"
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell Shadowbolt allows the mage to mold a bolt of shadow from the
Plane of Shadow, and fire it up to 120' range. A to-hit roll is
required, but is made as a fighter at a level of 1.5 times the mage's
level, rounded up. The Shadowbolt does damage by impact: at ranges
under 40', the damage is 1d4 per level, at ranges between 40' and 80'
the damage is 1d4 per 2 levels, and at greater ranges the damage is 1d4
per 4 levels. The number of dice should be rounded down in all cases
(thus, a fifth level mage at 50' does 2d4 damage, but a sixth level
mage does 3d4). The creature must make a DEX check to remain standing,
adjusted by a -1 for every two levels of the mage (again, rounded
down), as well as by mass:

 Mass (pounds)	DEX adjustment	Distance
 -------------	--------------	--------
 1 - 30		-8		25'
 31 - 60	-6		20'
 61 - 90	-4		15'
 91 - 120	-3		10'
 121 - 150	-2		5'
 151 - 180	-1		-
 181 - 210	0		-
 211 - 240	+1		-
 241 - 270	+2		-
 271 - 300	+3		-
 300 +		+4		-

The distance column indicates how far the target has been knocked away
from the mage if the modified DEX check was failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Veschiul's Shadowcurse (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

The Shadowcurse can affect any creature of the world of light. The area
of effect is one creature for every two levels of the mage above first;
i.e. a third level mage can affect one creature, a fifth can affect
two, and so on. The effect of the Shadowcurse is to afflict the victims
with some of the vulnerabilities of a shade. The effects depend on the
light conditions, as shown on the following table:

 Light		Abilities	Move		Maximum HP
 --------	---------	----		----------
 Bright		-2		1/2		1/2
 Average	-1		3/4		3/4
 Twilight	-		-		-
 Shadowy	-		-		-
 Night		-		-		-
 Darkness	-1		3/4		3/4

See the description of Shade in the MM II for exact descriptions of
these light conditions. The material component is a piece of pitch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wings (Alteration)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds to cast, 3 more for wings to grow
Area Of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster creates "wings" to appear out of the effected
creature's back. The wings are magically attached to the back area,
but are not attached in the sense that the person can be wearing
clothing or armour. They are not part of the creature. The wings need
a +1 magical weapon to hit, have AC 7 and have 2-12 hitpoints before
being destroyed. The spell has no effect on creatures that already have
wings. If there is no room for the wings to grow, e.g. because of
clothing, the spell is lost.

The wings can support a total of 200 pounds + 20 pounds per level. They
give an aerial maneuver rating of C, and fly at a rate of 12".

The material component of this spell is a bird's feather. The wings
appear to be the same colour as that of the bird feather used in the
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wound Closure (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell closes the wounds of the recipient to prevent bleeding and
infection, incidentally curing 1-4 hit points of damage. All of the
victim's wounds will be closed by a single casting, but further
application is possible to increase the healing effect. The spell can
be used on corpses to disguise the cause of death, but it does not work
on non-corporeal or extra-planar entities.

Note: A recent posting suggested that mages be able to cast healing
spells using 1d6 instead of 1d8. I believe the above spell description
shows my opposition to that approach (see also DMGv2 p. 43), unless you
intend to do away with clerics as a PC class. From a game mechanics
standpoint, such an approach would destroy the balance between priest
and mage, but there is a campaign background reason as well:
Pseudo-medieval medical knowledge would be atrocious. Clerical healing
is a gift from God or the gods, relatively omniscient and omnipotent
fellows, but magical curing would depend upon the mage's understanding
of the body and its functions. Thus you might find a wizard who can
pull the edges of a wound back together, as described above, but you
could not find one who could stimulate the replication of tissue of
various injured organs, insure an increased blood supply to the
affected regions, metabolise fat and increase respiration to enrich
said blood, etc. You certainly could not find a mage to cure diseases
before any microbes are discovered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zombie (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Skeleton in most respects. Instead of
creating a skeleton, it creates a zombie. The caster may control a
number of zombies made by this spell equal to half his level, round
down. The material component is a salve that costs 100 GP and 48 hours
of uninterrupted time.
