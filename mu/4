Acid Spray (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone shaped spray of acid to
extend outwards from the casters hand. The length of the cone is 1/2"
per level of the caster and the cone terminates with a circular area
with a radius of 1/8" per level of the caster. The start of the cone is
a circular area of 1' radius.

The damage from the acid is 1d4 + 1 per level of the caster.

The material component of the spell is a vial of acid which is thrown
in the direction which the cone will go.

Alcoreax's Icetrail (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates a wave of hardened ice which the caster actively
directs. After casting, the wizard simply taps the ground to activate
the spell. The wave of ice begins where the caster taps the ground,
and reaches its full dimensions after advancing only 10 feet. It
travels at a speed of 40 feet per round. The crest of the wave is 10
feet high and 15 feet wide; after the crest of the wave has passed, the
height of the remaining "trail" is only 3 feet high.

Creatures coming into contact with the crest suffer 2d6 points plus 1
point damage per level of the caster, or half this amount if the
creature is cold-using (in general, cold-dwelling creatures take half
damage from this spell, rounded down, and cannot suffocate as a result
of this spell). In addition, creatures of less than large size must
save against paralysation or be buried under the crest. Buried
individuals take an additional 1d3 points of cold damage each round and
must initially make another save against paralysation or start to
suffocate under the ice (use the rules for drowning). Trapped
creatures may break free, taking 1 more point of damage per level of
the caster from sharp ice.

The crest of the wave can be disrupted by 30 or more points of fire
damage, or negated by a wall of fire in any case. At the end of the
spell duration, the crest of the ice wave immediately loses all
momentum and melts; the spell will cause no more damage, and trapped
creatures can easily break free taking no damage. The material
components for this spell are a steel pin and a glass of icewater.

Alcoreax is the headmaster of Talarin Niulivius, one of the better
magical schools on the continent of Niulivia. Alcoreax's Icetrail is
the only spell he has researched. This one took him over five years to
develop.

Range: 240 yards
Components: V, S, M
Durations: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' x 30' square
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell, which functions only out of doors, causes thin streams of
hissing violet acid to fall within its area of effect.  All within the
area must save vs. spells or suffer full damage.  The spell inflicts
1d8 per two levels of the caster (rounded up).  All exposed items in
the area must also save vs. acid or be destroyed.

Characters under heavy cover which is not destroyed by the acid are
fully shielded from the effects of the spell.  The acid, once it
strikes the ground, harmlessly disappears.  The material component for
the spell is a small vial of aqua regia and a strip of zinc.

Alpha's Acid Resistance (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the subject complete immunity to acid, up to a
point.  The spell's basic duration is 10 rounds per level of the
caster.  However, for every point of acid damage that would have been
suffered by the character (after saving throws and any other
protections have been considered), the duration of this spell is
reduced by one round for every point of acid neutralised by the spell.
This spell also protects the subjects equipment from needing to make
any Item Saving Throws vs. acid for as long as the spell is in effect.
The material component is a small glass vial containing lye and water.

Alpha's Ball Lightning (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster of this spell can create one to four spheres of glowing
electrical energy.  These spheres resemble Dancing Lights (q.v.), and
the caster can control them in the same way.  The spheres can be moved
up to 120' per round.  Each ball is about 5' in diameter, and any
creature(s) approaching within 5' will dissipate that ball's charge.  A
save vs. spells results in half damage, indicating that contact was
across an air gap.  Note that more than one creature approaching within
5' in a single round can be affected by the ball is that occurs.

 The charge values are:

 1 lightning ball	4d12
 2 lightning balls	5d4 each
 3 lightning balls	2d6 each
 4 lightning balls	2d4 each

Alpha's Chill of the Void (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' wide, 5' per level long path
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings forth a wave of supernatural cold, rolling forth from
the caster's outstretched arms to the maximum area of effect.  Its cold
vacuum kills all normal vegetation in the area except for trees, which
have a 50%-100% chance to survive (DM's discretion, based on size and
native environment).  This cold inflicts 3d4 damage and the vacuum an
additional 3d4 to all living creatures within the area of effect.
Vegetable and fungoid monsters suffer double damage from this spell.
The material component is a piece of ice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Elemental Form (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

Use of this spell enable the spellcaster to transform the matter of a
creature's body into the stuff of a particular elemental plane.  The
elemental form enables the character to engage in normal combat with an
elemental of the same or opposite form (i.e. water would allow combat
vs.  water or fire elementals), or an elemental creature, without
needing a magical weapon to hit.  It also provides protection vs. the
same element as if a ring of warmth (+2 on saves, -1 per die of damage,
regenerate 1 HP of elemental-caused damage per turn).  The subject can
also exist without danger on the appropriate elemental plane, and can
move normally there.  It does not empower the subject with perceptions
not normally possessed (e.g. seeing through the rock of elemental
earth), but it does prevent elemental damage.  A character possessing a
ring of elemental command who assumes Elemental Form of the same type
gains the cumulative effects of both, and IS empowered with senses on
the appropriate plane as if in normal air.

If this spell is cast on the prime material, the spell will last 1 turn
per level of the caster.  If cast on the appropriate elemental plane,
or in the border Ethereal of that plane, it will last 12 turns per
level.  If cast while on an elemental or para-elemental plane different
from the form assumed, start with the base of 12 turns per level and
halve the duration for each plane removed.  An Elemental Form in
opposition to the plane the caster is on (air vs. earth, fire vs.
water) cannot be assumed at all.

The material component is a small amount of the appropriate element on
hand (a handful of clay or earth or a torch flame will suffice).

Alpha's Firefall (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is an improved version of the 2nd level Pyrotechnics spell
(q.v.), specifically the "fireworks" application of that spell.  That
portion of the spell functions exactly as the Pyrotechnics spell does
with respect to duration, area of effect, saving throw, and the
blinding effect created.  However, the "fireworks" created by this
spell are more along the lines of a geyser of brightly burning liquid
fire, arcing upwards approximately 60' into the air and raining down
within a 30' area surrounding the perimeter of the basic fire source.
All in this area of effect suffer 2d6 fire damage with no saving throw
allowed.  Further, a central prominence of flame is thrown upwards by
this spell, and the caster may direct this column of fire at a single
target within 60' of the fire source.  This plume of fire will inflict
4d10 damage to the victim, although a saving throw vs. breath weapon is
possible to halve this damage.

The liquid fire continues to burn during the following round, under the
same conditions as during the first round, although the fire is less
intense and causes only half the damage caused during the first round.
Combustibles in the area of effect must save vs. normal fire (if struck
only by the burning spray) or magical fire (if the victim of the
central plume fails his saving throw or if the central plume is
directed at an inanimate object) to avoid being set afire.  A creature
who is within the area of the spray who is targeted by the central
plume will not also suffer fire damage from the spray, as this minor
flame is all but lost in the fury of the central prominence.  The spray
does not fall within the area of the original fire source, but only
within 30' of the perimeter of the fire source.  An aerial creature
flying within 60' above the rising geyser of liquid fire is affected
just as a creature on the ground would be, and may also be targeted
with the central plume, if the caster so desires.  The material
component for this spell is a lump of pitch mixed with sulfur,
saltpeter, and magnesium, as well as an existing fire source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha's Flames of Falroth (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures an extra-dimensional black flame to surround a
single object or creature within range.  This fire has exactly the
opposite effect of normal fire, in that it restores creatures or
objects burned to destruction by fire or acid to their original state.
This will not restore life to a person slain by a Fireball spell, but
it will restore the body to full health, such that a Raise Dead spell
will bring the character back to full physical health (though an amount
of time equal to the time dead must be spent recovering from the
psychological shock).  Similarly, it will not restore enchantment to a
once-destroyed magic item, though a Limited Wish spell is capable of
restoring the lost enchantment to the item reconstructed by the Flames
of Falroth.

In order to restore an item or creature, the target must fail a saving
throw of the same type that resulted in its destruction.  Hence, plate
mail destroyed by the breath of a black dragon must fail a saving throw
vs. acid, and an adventurer felled by a Fireball must fail a save vs.
spells.  For effects against which there is no save (e.g. Wall of
Fire), assume the save to be as against breath weapon for creatures or
magical fire for items.  It is thus more difficult to restore items
that were more difficult to destroy in the first place.  One such save
may be attempted each round, and as many saves as desired may be
attempted during the use of this spell.  No object can ever be affected
by this spell after the spell has been used on it once, whether or not
it was successful.  Once the save is failed, the object will take 2
rounds to be fully reconstructed from its remains.  The Flames of
Falroth may be moved to another object or creature at any time during
the spell's duration, with 1 round of concentration on the part of the
caster.

The Flames of Falroth are very hostile to ordinary fire.  They may be
used as a fire extinguisher or sorts, and will extinguish a 10' cube of
normal flame every round.  Magical fire spells must be checked as per
Dispel Magic, but multiplying the caster's level by 2 for the purposes
of determining whether the target spell has resisted the effects of the
Flames of Falroth.  If this Dispelling attempt is unsuccessful, the
Flames of Falroth will vanish back from whence they came.

If cast at an elemental fire creature of any sort, the Flames of
Falroth will automatically cause 6d6 damage to that creature.  After
this initial attack, the target creature may make a save vs. spell at
-3.  If successful, the Flames disappear without causing further harm.
If failed, however, the Flames continue to attack the creature's very
substance, causing 3d6 damage every round.  A new saving throw is
allowed each round, the chance to save improving by 1 each round (-2
after the second round, then -1, etc.).  This continues until the
creature is dead, the caster moves the flames away (after which time
that creature will no longer be affected by the Flames of Falroth), or
until the spell expires or a save is made--in both of these cases, the
Flames disappear.

A fire-using or dwelling creature that uses fire but is not native to
the Elemental Plane of Fire (e.g. fire giant, red dragon, chimera) will
not be harmed by the Flames of Falroth, but any external fire powers
(fire breath, spells, immolation, etc.) will cause only half normal
damage, as their effectiveness is mitigated by the Flames.  The
material component is a bit of green wood, a handful of ashes, a smoky
quartz crystal, and a piece of obsidian.

Alpha's Hunting Pack (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons into the caster's vicinity a pack of canines who
will fight on behalf of the caster, if such is required.  The
composition of the pack will be as follows:

 01-10	4-16 jackals
 11-60	3-12 wild dogs
 61-90	2-8 wolves
 91-00	1-4 dire wolves

The pack will follow commands to the best of its ability, so long as
they are relatively simple (attack, return, heel, etc.).  If attacked
by the caster or his fellows, all creatures summoned will instantly
disappear.  The hounds can track as well as a 5th level ranger, and can
be commanded to perform this activity if it is requested of them (such
as by allowing them to smell an article of clothing from the creature
to be tracked, etc.).  The hounds will arrive 1-10 rounds after the
spell is cast.  The material components are a piece of fresh, uncooked
meat and a finely crafted silver or ivory hunting horn, worth not less
than 100 GP, which must be sounded during the casting of the spell.

Alpha's Rainbow Blast (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' wide, 10' + 5' per level long beam
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is very much like the second level Rainbow Beam spell, but
is much more powerful.  Besides a slightly larger area of effect, and
the fact that a solid object will not stop the beam unless larger than
2' wide and formed of solid stone or some such similar dense material,
i.e.  the beam is not stopped by mere flesh, even if armoured, but
would be stopped by a stone wall.

The spell does 2-7 (1d6+1) points of damage per level of the caster.
The swirling, coruscating tendrils of multi-hued light also have
properties as listed under the Rainbow Beam spell.  A target resistant
to one or more of these forms of attack takes -1 point of damage per
die per attack that it is resistant to.  The obverse applies for
creatures that are particularly vulnerable to a certain form of attack
(e.g. a frost giant is immune to cold, but is not particularly
vulnerable to fire, so it would take -1 point of damage per die.  A
green slime, vulnerable only to fire and cold, would take -5 points of
damage per die.)  The indigo (holy water) beam does normal damage
except to creatures affected by unholy water (paladins, lammasu, etc.,
who are considered as being resistant), and those affected by holy
water (undead, demons, etc., who are considered as specifically
vulnerable).

The victim is entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful,
indicates that the beam has missed.  It may hit another target,
though.  Also, if a target is struck by the beam, he must save vs.
petrification or be struck in the face and blinded for 3-6 rounds.

The material component for this spell is a small diamond worth not less
than 100 GP.

Alpha's Ray of Paralysis (Alteration)
Level: 4

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The caster extends his arm, points his finger, and speaks a word to
cast the spell.  A thin, light blue ray leaps from the caster's
finger.  The intended target must save vs. petrification.  If the save
is failed, then the creature is struck by the beam and, unless the
creature possesses some innate magic resistance, is paralysed for 2
rounds per level of the caster.  If the save is made, the pencil-thin
ray has missed its original target and continues on in a straight line
to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the path of the beam must
make the same saving throw or be struck and paralysed.  If the ray
actually strikes, there is no save vs.  its effects.  Size L creatures
must save at -1, size H at -2, and size G at -4.  Conversely, size S
creatures save at +1 and size T at +3.  The ray can affect only target
in any event.  The material component is a clear gem or a piece of
amber worth at least 100 GP.

Area of Effect: 1' diameter, 5' per level long ray
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls forth a seething black ray shot through with veins of
green fire.  All creatures in the path of the spell will suffer d4
damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20d4.  A successful
save vs.  breath weapon will result in only half damage.  A creature
that is immune to fire or to energy drain will suffer only one-half
damage (one-quarter if a successful save is made).  If the damage
rolled exceeds a target's remaining hit points, that target is
disintegrated.  The material component is a black opal worth at least
500 GP.

Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M

Area of Effect: 10' per level square area
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a very bright flashing jolt of sheet lightning
within the area of effect.  All those in the area receive 4d4
electrical damage with no saving throw.  In addition, those within must
save vs. petrification to avoid being blinded for 1d3 rounds and must
save vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 1d3 rounds.  Those
carrying large, mostly metallic weapons (e.g. swords, battle axes) or
wearing partial metal armour (studded-chain) save at -2 vs. the
stunning and suffer +1 per die of damage.  Those in full metal armour
(splint or better) save at -4 vs. the stunning and suffer double
damage.  The material component is a bit of fur and a sheet of fine
crystal worth at least 50 GP.

Bergil's Fire Bolt (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The spell creates a powerful bolt of plasma that in inflicts 1d8 points
of damage per level to anyone in it's area of effect (maximum damage is
12d8). This bolt is 60' long by 5' wide, it cannot be forked. It
streaks outward much like a Lightning Bolt. It does not reflect,
however. If the Firebolt hits a wall the plasma spreads out in 5'
radius hemisphere, anyone in the hemisphere takes damage. Thus it is
possible to hit someone standing near a wall twice with the Firebolt,
once with the bolt and once with the hemisphere. The Firebolt
automatically sets fire to anything combustible in the path or in the
hemisphere. The bolt has the same penetration ability as a Lightning
Bolt. The material components are: a stick, a bit of sulfur, and a dab
of royal honey. All are consumed.

Branit's Backstabbing Surprise (Conjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None or 1/2

This spell provides protection against backstabbing. When the recipient
of the spell is backstabbed, a cloud of acid is created behind the
spell recipient which blows back and out to form a semi-sphere 8 feet
in radius. All within the area of effect, the recipient not included,
take 6d4 + 6 points of acid damage. Note that the backstabber gets no
save (due to surprise and proximity), all others receive half damage
upon successful save.

A backstabbing attack is any physical attack or combination of attacks
initiated from behind which causes damage equal to 1/5 or more of the
victims hit points at the time of the attack, assuming the attacker is
within 8 feet of the victim when the attack is initiated. The spell is
in effect until dispelled or discharged. This spell will work in
combination with other defensive spells.

The material component is 100 red ants which must be rolled in the
casters hands, the husks then thrown over each shoulder of the
recipient, and the juice rubbed into the recipients back.

Broom (Enchantment)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 hours + 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Broom touched
Saving Throw: None

A witch uses this spell to enchant her broom with the power of flight.
The broom flies with a movement rate of 30, minus 1 per 14 pounds above
182 pounds which it is carrying, and it can climb and turn at an angle
of 30 in response to the verbal command of its mistress. While the
enchantment lasts, the witch can summon the broom from up to 300 yards
away. The material components are a broom, which is not used up by the
casting, and a feather, which is. The long casting time is necessary to
set the command words, but if the spell is recast on an already
enchanted broom, it has a casting time of 3.

Chaos Vision (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell offers some protection from teleport spells by constantly
shifting and shaping what an area looks like.  Thus a mage cannot use
information gathered previously to teleport to the effected area as the
surroundings will have seemingly changed.  Objects located in this
environment or entering it will be effected also, first appearing as
one object or animal and then shifting to another.

Another use found for this spell is as a trap.  Slimes, molds and other
creatures that don't need senses to attack can be placed in this
environment and effectively are invisible.

Any attacks on anything in the area of effect is hindered by a -4
modifier to hit.  Note that true seeing and similar magics that see
through illusions will likewise penetrate this one.  No damage will be
taken by being in the illusion. ( Unless from something else physical
also there of course! )  The main purpose is simply to constantly
conceal.

Cheffield's Kingly Feast (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person fed per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Cheffield's Major Feast except that it brings
into existence food and drink which is of extremely high quality. The
food is excellent and nourishing. The drink is rich and tasty. This
meal is truly fit for a king and his kind. In addition to the main meal
are appetisers to serve before and desserts to be eaten afterward.
Nobody who is being served by this spell will be unable to finish their
food.

The material components of this spell are rich spices (40 GP) and a
good quality wine (minimum 10 GP) which must be mixed together when the
spell is cast.

As a final note it must be pointed out that the four and twenty black
birds baked in a pie is an optional feature.

Damian's Insulated Envelope (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

Due to his personal dislike of lightning the archmage Damian crafted
this spell to specifically counter its harmful effects. When cast, this
spell seems to cover the caster in a pale blue light resembling an
envelope. Once cast the caster gains 2 Benefits (much like fire
shield).

1) A save vs. lightning at + 2 indicates no damage to the caster. A
failed save merely indicates Half damage. If at any time the caster is
hit by any acid or acid spell the caster must save normally or take
double damage.

2) If any melee attacks are made on the caster, on a successful strike
the caster takes normal Damage but so does the attacker.

Deadthought (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This is essentially telepathy with a corpse, as the forensic wizard
probes the brain of the deceased for specific data. The dungeon master
must decide if the information sought is basic, well known, merely
known, or forgotten. The table below lists the chance of finding the
information and the amount of time required by the search (if location
is in fact possible), but the DM can altar these numbers if the body is
in a particularly advanced state of decomposition.

 Type of	Chance of	Time
 Information	Finding		Required	Examples
 -----------	---------	------------	--------------------
 Basic		96%		1 round		Name and profession
 Well Known	70%		2-8 rounds	Relating to current
	 					mission
 Known		30%		3-12 rounds	Relating to previous
 						missions
 Forgotten	2%		11-20 rounds	Overheard once

This spell will continue as long as the wizard concentrates, but on
every round there is a 1% chance of that he will go insane. The
material component is a pair of metal helmets, linked by a copper
wire.

Deave (Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a temporary sensory overload to occur in all the
sensory nerve endings of the target creature. Because of this overload
of all the senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, hearing) will be "burnt
out" for the duration of the spell. The creature will find himself in a
state of total sensory deprivation for the spells duration. This means
that the creature will not be able to see, hear, taste, feel or sell
anything. The creature will remain completely helpless for the
duration.

There is an additional side effect of this spell. Because the loss of
the senses can be so shocking an experience to some creatures, there is
a 1% chance per point of intelligence and wisdom that the creature will
suffer from the insanity of Catatonia for a duration of 2-8 weeks
afterward. This can be cured with a Cure Insanity.

If the creature makes its saving throw vs. spells, then the spell does
not completely take effect. Only 1 to 4 of the creatures senses are
affected (determined randomly). Note that some combination of lost
senses could leave the creature helpless anyway.

The material components for this spell are a small leather hoof, a
shrill whistle several sharp pins, smelling salts, and a drop of lemon
juice.

This spell throws the victim back to the location he occupied at a pont
in the recent past. It does not turn back time, it merely teleports
back along the victim's "time line." This restriction makes the
resistance that the magic must overcome much less than a full "teleport
other" spell would have to fight. Deja Vu sends the victim to the
position he occupied 1d6 hours in the past per level of the caster.

If the victim would be placed inside another object or creature, the
victim is placed in a random direction along his time line until an
unobstructed location is found. The material component is a
time-keeping device which is destroyed at the time the spell is
memorised by the caster.

Detect Spellcasting (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10-yard per level radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to scan a surrounding area for spells
being cast by other magic users. The affected area has a radius of 10
yards per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 200 yards); the
caster may make the area of effect smaller if he wishes. Any wizard
spells that are currently being cast, will be detected (priestly magic
is not affected). The caster is instantly aware of the school of magic
of all spells in this area; the name of the spell will also be known,
if it has already been learned by the caster; in addition, the caster
gains a general feeling of the location of the caster of each of the
spells (i.e. approximately 30 feet east).

The relative strength of two spells from the same school will also be
detected. For example, if a Meteor Swarm and a Burning Hands spell are
both being cast in the area of effect, this spell will detect which is
more powerful (this will also work for two Fireball spells cast by two
wizards of different levels); the actual level of the spell is not
revealed, and two spells of different schools cannot be compared in
this way.

The caster may choose one spell to target for specific information;
this includes: the name and level of the spell (as well as the caster's
level, if that is relevant to the strength of the spell), the spell's
target (object, location, creature, etc.), and the exact location of
the caster. Illusions of level 4 or less are revealed, as long as the
caster is of higher level than the caster of the illusion. Illusions of
level 5 or higher will return a false reading (i.e. what the caster
believes the spell to be) unless the caster has already disbelieved
that illusion.

This spell does not detect spells which are already in effect. It does
however detect all spells as they are cast, as long as the duration
lasts (i.e.  if this spell is cast by a 10th level wizard, it will
detect all spells that are cast in the following ten rounds).

This spell does have a drawback: the maximum number of spells that can
be processed safely is equal to the caster's intelligence divided by
three (round fractions down). If there are more than this number of
spells being cast inside the area of effect, the caster must make a
successful system shock roll or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds (this
roll must be made every round this condition exists).

The material component for this spell is a powered gem worth at least
100 GP which must be tossed in the air when the spell is cast.

Dreamoore's Eldritch Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell protects the recipient from any magic energy based attacks.
Each individual manifestation (e.g. magic missiles, eldritch spheres,
etc.) directed at the recipient is absorbed by the shield, whether or
not they successfully hit. The eldritch shield can withstand up to 1d4
+ 1 attack per three levels.

Note that regular attacks also reduce an eldritch shield without any
penalty, and the shield may only absorb spells which the caster has
sufficient levels to cast. (e.g. a 9 hit die eldritch shield can
protect from 5-8 magic missiles or similar spells, while a griffon
would take off three from the shield and still inflict normal damage).
The material component is sapphire and diamond dust which is sprinkled
upon the creature to be protected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dreamoore's Warding Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The warding shield is a unique magical screen which encompasses one
creature and protects it from harm. The shield remains completely
invisible until struck by any attack, including weapons and spells
which cause direct damage. Then it then flares pale blue, absorbing
part or all of the attack (any damage which is not absorbed goes
directly to the character using the shield).

The warding shield may absorb up to base 1d4 HP damage + 2 points per
level of the caster. If a magic resistant creature attacks the spell's
host, then its resistance is checked first. Success indicates that the
shield is by- passed during that attack, and damage goes directly to
the person being protected. However, the shield remains intact until it
loses all hit points, gets dispelled, or until all hit points elapse,
at a rate of 1 hit die per turn. A person may have only one warding
shield at a time.

The material component is 50 GP worth of diamond dust which is thrown
into the air as the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eldarr's Flameshroud (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level (but see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the caster is enveloped in an invisible shroud
of flames; a True Seeing spell or similar magic will reveal the shroud,
and a Detect Magic will reveal strong lines of abjuration and evocation
magic. The spell imparts on the caster, the equivalent of fire
resistance for the duration of the spell (see description of ring of
fire resistance).

In addition to the protection aspect of this spell, the caster may also
use it offensively: any target that comes within 10 feet of the caster
may be attacked using the shroud; a small finger of (clearly visible)
flames shoots from the shroud and strikes the victim, inflicting 1d4
points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to a maximum
of 1d4 + 20). A successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by half.
Only one such attack may be made per round, and each attack reduces the
spell's duration by one round (thus, an attack may not be made the last
round the spell is in affect).

Anyone who scores a successful melee hit on the caster while he is
under the protection of this spell, suffers damage equal to that
inflicted by an attack from the shroud (1d4 + 1 per level); again, a
successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by one half. The duration
of the spell is not affected in this case.

The material component for this spell is any normal cape with a chunk
of sulphur placed in the pocket; the cape must be worn throughout the
duration of the spell; if it is removed, the spell ends prematurely.
The cape is not affected by the casting of this spell, but the sulphur
is consumed when the spell ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eldarr's Shockshroud (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level (but see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is nearly identical to Eldarr's Flameshroud; in covers the
caster in an invisible shroud of electricity; the shroud is detectable
by the same means covered in the Flameshroud description. This spell
provides the user with immunity to lightning and other electrical
attacks for the duration of the spell.

The caster may use the shroud to conduct electrical attacks in the same
manner as that for the Flameshroud spell; damage is identical, and each
attack reduces the duration by one round. The shroud will also provide
protection vs. melee attacks as per the Flameshroud, with electricity
again replacing flames.

In addition to the cape (which is not harmed), this spell requires a
specimen of any electricity-using creature, such as an electric eel;
this specimen is consumed when the spell ends.

Enemy Blink (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 4d6 creatures
Saving Throw: Negates

Makes enemy blink if save failed. Otherwise like blink. Good for use if
enemy near cliff or large body of water. The number of creatures
affected is determined randomly, by rolling 4d6.

Cannot make people save twice, ie, "I've got 12, I use them all on him,
have him save 12 times".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fellstar's Flaming Water (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10' per level radius area
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell will cause an area of water to instantly burst into flames
as if covered with oil and set alight. The center of the area of effect
may be as far away as 10 yards per level of the caster; the area of
burning water has a radius of 10 feet per level of the caster, but may
be smaller if the caster desires. The spell must be cast on an open
body of water, such as a lake, river, or ocean; it may not be cast at a
container of water on the person of an individual.

If the center of the area of effect is on the surface, the flames will
remain only on the surface; if the spell is cast underwater, the flames
will form a sphere (if the distance between the surface and the center
of the area of effect is less than 10' per level of the caster, the
flames will obviously not form a perfect sphere; in this case, the
surface of the water will burn as well).

The fire will last 2 rounds per level of the caster, or until
extinguished; the flames may not be doused with water, as this added
water will burn as well.  The fire must be extinguished by magical
means (i.e. dispelled or via a Fire Quench or similar magic), or
allowed to expire. If cast underwater, the duration of this spell is
halved.

The flames from this fire are sufficient enough to start ships on fire,
and any creature caught in the area of effect suffers 3d6 points of
damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (to a maximum of 3d6+20).
A successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by half. If this spell
is used to attack a water elemental or similar creature, the damage is
doubled, and there is a -4 penalty to the save.

The material components for this spell is a vial filled with a water
and oil mixture.

Glamden's Mixer (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One potion
Saving Throw: None

This spell requires the caster to have a potion of any type in his or
her possession. The potion is held in the caster's hand, and when the
spell is cast, the contents is instantly removed from its container and
reappears in a potion container in the target's possession. The DM then
makes a potion compatibility check (DMG 2ed. pg. 135) for the target
potion and applies the results normally. If the target has one or more
potion containers in sight, the caster may choose which one to affect.
If the target has no containers in sight, then one is affected
randomly; if the target has no potion containers in his possession,
then the spell has no effect. This will also work on a potion that is
just about to be quaffed, as long as the caster gains the initiative.

The only material component for this spell is the potion to be mixed
with the target's potion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hand of Time (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5-8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

After casting this spell, the death master's hand will bear a baneful
curse, for the next creature he touches (possibly requiring an attack
roll) will instantly become 4d10 years older. The spell lasts for one
round per level of the caster or until discharged, and it cannot be
reversed.

Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 12"

This spell is like hold person except as noted above and that the
saving throw is made at -6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hydro Shield (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the mage appears to be covered in a mist of
water. Variation A is coloured blue or green; variation B is coloured
violet or blue. Any creature striking the spell caster with body or
hand-held weapons will inflict normal damage upon the mage, but the
attacker will take double the damage so inflicted! The other powers of
this spell depend on the variation being used:

Version A: Any electrical attacks will be saved at +2 on the die, and
will do either half damage (if save is failed) or no damage at all (if
save is made). Acid based attacks are normal, but if the mage fails the
required saving throw, he sustains double damage! The material
component for this version is a bit of tree gum.

Version B: Any acid attacks will be saved at +2 on the die and will do
either half damage (on an unsuccessful save) or no damage (if save is
successful). Electrical attacks are normal, but if the mage fails to
make the required save he sustains double damage from that attack.

The material component for this version is an alkylaine substance.

Illumine (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One or more 10-foot radius globes (see below)
Saving Throw: Special

The Illumine spell acts as a multiple light spell. The wizard may
create two globes of light, with an additional globe per two levels of
experience of the wizard above the 7th. Immediately after casting, two
globes appear where the caster wills. The additional globes appear in
the following round. The wizard must spend that round specifying the
centers of spell effect, and may take no other action in that round or
all succeeding globes are lost. The caster may permanently dispel some
or all of the globes at any time during the duration of the spell. The
material component for the spell is one piece of phosphorescent moss
for each globe. In all respects other than the ones above, this spell
conforms to the restrictions of the light spell.

Illumine is the fourth of six spells researched by the mage Auralon
Deathrin in his lifetime. It was developed as a partial solution to
the annually increasing crime rate in the capital of Travinthia. (They
make good streetlights with some form of spell extension!)

Improved Magic Mouth (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M

Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: None

Like Magic Mouth but can speak command words to activate magical items,
Stash spells etc. (but can not cast spells).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independent Spectral Hand (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One opponent
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, shaped from the caster's
life force, to materialise within the spell range and move as the
caster desires. Any touch attack spell of 6th level or less that is
subsequently cast by the wizard can be delivered by the spectral hand
The spell attacks as the caster at a +2 bonus to hit. The caster may
perform other actions. The hand is AC -3 and may be hit by magic only.
Any damage dispels it and does 1d6 points to the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inertia (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to freeze one creature or object up to 100
pounds per level, limit regardless of orientation. Creatures flying
through the air would be frozen in place (remaining in the air),
immovable until the second command word. The caster is free to cast
this spell upon himself.  If the subject of the spell is unwilling, it
receives a saving throw vs. magic, a successful save negating.

The caster must point at the creature or object to be stopped, and
utters the first command word. If the spell is successful (guaranteed
in the case of objects within the caster's weight limit), the item is
frozen in the air, immovable, unless a dispel magic, or other such
spell is cast, or until the caster utters the second command word. Upon
saying the second command word, the object or creature resumes its
initial motion. For example, cast upon a falling chest, would stop the
chest in the air. Upon the second command, the chest would resume
falling, even if someone had climbed on top of it. If some poor slob
happened to be standing directly beneath the chest at the time of the
second command... If cast at a knight on a horse, for example, the
caster must specify mount or rider. If cast at the mount, the rider
would probably continue in his original direction, just without his
mount. Cast on the rider, he would stay hanging in the air, as his
mount ran away.

Physical force is insufficient to move frozen objects, so they could,
for example, be used as anchors for ropes, etc. The caster must be able
to see the majority of the object of the spell, so he couldn't, for
example, cast it upon something in somebody's backpack.

The material component of the spell is a silver whistle, which is blown
prior to shouting the command word.

Jamye's Greased Pig (Alteration, Conjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature + 1 creature per 4 levels of the caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is a more powerful version of the third-level Haste spell,
with the first-level Grease spell thrown in too.  The people that the
spell is cast upon suffer none of the side effects of the grease (i.e.
they don't drop their weapons, they don't slip, etc.) but those that
try to attack or grab them will.  It negates special attacks by
creatures that inflict damage automatically every round after a
successful hit (i.e. stirges or executioner's hoods) - the creature
must roll to hit every round due to the slipperiness of the target.
Otherwise, it conforms to the normal Haste spell ( -2 on initiative,
double movement rate, double number of attacks per round, ages
recipient 1 year).  It is not cumulative with Haste or other Greased
Pig spells.

The material components for this spell are a bit of butter and an anise
seed for each recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamye's Headless Flying Roasted Pig (Enchantment, Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell summons a pre-prepared headless flying roasted pig. The pig
flies at a rate of 30, and is under the control of the caster (who must
give it his full attention).  The pig is magically funny; anyone who
looks at the pig (except the caster) must save vs. spell every round
that the pig is in his field of view or fall down laughing until the
pig leaves.  Laughing victims are at a -2 "to hit" until the spell
expires.

Victims with an intelligence of 4 or less, that are meat-eaters, will
be attracted to the pig's delicious aroma and must save at a -6 or
spend the rest of the spell's duration trying to catch it.  If they are
vegetarians, they are unaffected.  Those with Intelligences of 5-9 save
vs. the laughter effect at a -4.  Those with Intelligences of 10-14
save at a -2.  Those with Intelligences of 15-19 save normally, and
those who are more intelligent than that are unaffected.

The pig cannot be caught or attacked; those attempting to do so
automatically succumb to the laughter.  The pig has no other attacks
besides its magical nature.  It can be Banished or Abjured; Dispel
Magic merely terminates the caster's control over it.  If the Dispel
Magic is successful, the pig will leave 50% of the time and stay 50% of
the time, the magical laughter effect will not be dispelled, and the
caster will become vulnerable to the laughter's effects.

The material components are a baked, spiced apple and a hummingbird
feather.  Additionally, a pig of no less than 50 pounds must be
beheaded, roasted and otherwise prepared ahead of time; this pig does
not have to be carried with the spellcaster but must not be eaten, as
it is consumed by the spell at the time of casting.

Jamye's Morning After (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 rounds per level (see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One intelligent creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell takes effect after the victim has had a minimum of two hours
of sleep.  The victim loses all memory of events that occurred between
the time the spell was cast and when he awoke.

The victim will remember the existence of any material components used
in the spell.

The effects of the spell last 1d6 rounds per level of the caster.  The
caster should not be told the duration of the spell.

Jibril's Anti-Magic Shield (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One mage per three levels
Saving Throw: None

The recipients of this spell are made more aware of the magic around
them and are also more able to affect it. They therefore have a magic
resistance of 5% per level of the caster.  A dispel magic is only half
as likely to dispel this spell.  Note: this spell only effects Mages.

Justin's Mental Map (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Area of Effect: 1-mile radius area
Saving Throw: None

Outdoors only, this spell gives the caster an aerial view of the
countryside within 1 mile of the caster.  Only large features visible
from above are noted, like rivers, woods, fields, large buildings, and
clearings, but not people, caves, small streams, or the like. Material
component is powdered pineal gland.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mimic (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell forces some humanoid creature in the caster's line of sight
to begin mimicing his actions. The creature's actions will directly
reflect those of the caster, regardless of position or orientation. The
creature will be frozen momentarily at the onset of the spell, but
after that segment of inaction, the creature begins mimicing the
caster.

This can be potentially harmful for the target, if say for example, the
caster waves his hand in the vicinity of his neck, and the target
happens to be wielding a sword.

Once the spell is cast, the caster need not be able to see the target
for the target to mimic his actions. The target does get a second save
if forced to do actions that are obviously lethal, such as the
aforementioned hand waving example. If the target passes outside of the
range of the spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of the spell is a small ivory figurine, which is
broken to bits in the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missile Multiplication I (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1/5 round
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One missile
Saving Throw: None

A missile must be fired within the next twelve seconds. This spell
makes 3-18 missiles out of one. Only normal missiles are affected.

The stuff disappears one round after shooting, but their effects stay.
A nasty assassin in my game used the fifth-level version of this spell
with sleep-poison darts to capture a PC.

You have to roll to hit for each missile, by the way. However, if your
first missile hits, you have a +3 on all thereafter.

Mystyk's Backlash (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster is surrounded by an invisible shell
of energy; this shell is invisible to the naked eye, but a True Seeing
spell or similar magic will reveal it, and a Detect Magic spell will
detect strong lines of abjuration magic with weaker evocation lines.
While under the protection of this spell, if the caster is hit in
melee, the shell will emit a burst of pure energy that lashes out at
the attacker. The energy will inflict an identical amount of damage as
that inflicted on the caster by the melee attack (the caster still
receives normal damage). If the attacker makes a successful save vs.
spells, he will only suffer half damage. The shell will continue to
emit energy bursts on attackers as long as the spell's duration lasts,
or until the shell is dispelled.

The material component for this spell is a small, metal shield and a
gem worth at least 400 GP. Both components are destroyed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Negative Bolt (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 2" + 1/3" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This combat spell projects a bolt of negative energy. Some
practitioners believe it to be merely energy from the negative material
plane... Said Spellcasters are wrong. The spell actually projects raw
anti-matter in a bolt of anti-energy. Materials affected by the bolt
tend to disintegrate and be consumed... Spell wards and defences tend
to dissolve also. Specific defences exist for the genre of spells
similar to this one but they are secrets kept for self-defence.

The bolt only does 1d3 per level of the caster but it also has the
effect of dispelling first and second level defensive spells. Spells
third through fifth need to make a saving throw based on that of their
caster to save and sixth level spells only fail on a 1. Though the
duration of any such affected spell is usually reduced on a ratio to
the level of the spell (GM decision as to what, though I wouldn't
suggest more than 1/2 duration).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pander's Whirlwind Travel (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None or special

This spell encapsulates the caster and possibly more people and/or
equipment inside a conjured whirlwind. One of two variations of this
spell may be cast without prior preparation at the option of the
caster.

The first variation is used by the caster for personal transportation
or protection. While encapsulated in the whirlwind's eye the wizard can
view the outside normally and cause the whirlwind to travel over any
relative continuous surface with short hops over ditches or small
obstacles not over 4 feet in height being possible. The caster may not
carry more than his normal encumbrance and all equipment must be on his
person (exceeding this limit causes the whirlwind to fizzle). No other
creature may occupy the whirlwind unless it is carried. On solid ground
the whirlwind can move up to 24" + 1" per level above 5th level. Rate
of movement is the same whether moving uphill, downhill, or on stairs.
Over loose sand or marsh the movement rate is 2/3 of normal and over
water the movement rate is 1/2 of normal. Wind velocities can affect
the rate of speed. Although the caster may cast any spell from within
the eye, none will breach the barrier of the winds and spells such as
Magic Missile, Fireball, or Lightning Bolt will bounce back towards the
caster, possibly ruining an otherwise fine day.

This variation's duration is 1 turn per level and can be turned on and
off any time during the duration. It takes 5 segments to turn the winds
on or off (a good mage would calculate a spell so that it goes off the
segment after the whirlwind stops). The mage is still susceptible to
outside damage from spells, but only takes 1/2 or no damage if saving
throws are made while inside the whirlwind. Projectiles of a small
nature will not penetrate the winds and the mage's Armour Class and
saving throws vs. dodging have a +4 bonus while inside the eye of the
whirlwind.

The second variation is not as fast and cannot be turned on and off (it
is only good for a one-way trip). But, its area of effect is a 20-foot
diameter column which is 10 feet high (centered on the caster) and it
can carry along anything in the area of effect on a relatively safe
ride over long distances. Movement conforms as above but the base rate
is 12" + 1" per level of the spellcaster over 5th level and the
duration is 1 hour per level. All spells cast from inside conform as
above, as do effects of area spells cast at the whirlwind. All inside
have a +4 Armour Class bonus since they cannot be seen but there are no
dodging bonuses and saves vs. dodging are based on the caster for the
entire group. Weight is not a factor when determining what is picked up
for the ride. Anything not securely rooted to the ground will be picked
up. Once started, the winds may only be exited or penetrated after
startup by making a successful saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of
-1 for every two levels of the caster, rounded down. Flying creatures
who enter or exit from the top have no penalty on their save. Creatures
larger than the area of effect will simply push the whirlwind away if
they try to enter it. The caster may stop the winds at any time.

The material component of this spell is a piper's flute which is played
to bring the whirlwind from the elemental plane of Air.

Pobithakor's Alarm (Divination) Reversible
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None

This spell, when cast, will detect and instantly alert the caster
whenever the caster is the subject of information gathering spells or
divination spells such as ESP or know alignment. The caster will have a
general idea of what is being used (mind reading, truth detection,
etc.) upon him.

The reverse of the spell will cause the caster to have no chance to
discover that such spells are being used upon him, i.e. the caster
would not be able to detect someone scrying upon him.

The material components of the spell is an eye from a very keen eyed
creature such as a hawk or a dragon. The reverse of the spell requires
that the eye be punctured.

Protection from Domination (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level

This spell protects the effected creature from all sorts of domination
attacks. This includes psionics and spells which do domination.

Rathe's Mage Lock (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One portal
Saving Throw: None

The Mage Lock spell is an advanced form of the Wizard Lock spell. There
are two main changes from the latter. First, while the spell is in
effect, the portal cannot be damaged or destroyed by any physical (not
magical) means short of an elemental. Note, however, that magical means
of destroying the door (e.g. Fireball, disintegrate, etc) still work as
normal, and if the door is destroyed, the spell is broken. If the spell
is dispelled or negated by any means whatsoever (even temporarily), the
portal will crumble into dust.

Second, the spell has another application; it can be placed upon an
object. The effect of this is to allow anyone wearing or carrying the
object to open any Mage Locks by the same caster. For example, if one
of Rathe's Mage Locked bracelets was worn, the wearer could open any
door Mage Locked by Rathe (but not by any other mage). The material
component is half a pound of iron filings for the first application and
100 GP worth of diamond dust for the second.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resist Acid (Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the third level mage spell resist electricity
(q.v.), except this spell provides some protection from acid and acid
based attacks. The material component for this spell is an alkylaine
substance.

Rhuva's Counter-Scry (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-yard radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

The caster will automatically detect any scrying attempt in the area of
effect.  The scryer must make a save vs. spells to realise that the
scrying is being tampered with.  If he does not immediately terminate
the scrying, the caster of the counter-scry gets a clear image of the
spy and a general location.  He can cast any ranged spells through the
link at the scryer, who receives all normal saves.  The caster of the
counter-scry can also simply jolt the scryer, causing the connection to
be terminated.  The detection of a scrying attempt will interrupt
spell-casting.  (It is suggested that "detect scrying" be made a second
level spell, with a more limited duration and vaguer description of the
scryer.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhuva's Tracker (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: Negates

The mage casts this spell, and hurls a small carved scarab at a target
within range.  A creature or object in a creature's possession gets a
save to avoid the scarab. It clings invisibly to its victim, noticed
only in a determined search.  The caster then always knows where the
victim is (distance & direction), provided it is within one mile per
level, and the target is not enclosed in lead.  The tracker can be
renewed each morning by recasting the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarius' Golden Triangles of Protection (Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One floating 2' high triangle plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering triangular plates of force which
move around the caster in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
improved by a factor of 1 for every three circles still active and any
successful physical melee attack (including boulders, ballista, or
attack forms similar to dragon's belly flop maneuver) will be deflected
automatically. Deflected creatures of large-size (or higher) who are
deflected must still land somewhere, possibly injuring friend or foe.
Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective strength of 23 or
greater require a saving throw versus breath weapons to deflect.

Each triangle is able to sustain 8 hit points of damage before
disrupting, so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to
disrupt a triangle (chosen randomly) the triangle will remain active.
For every 5 triangles active, the effects of breath weapons directed at
the caster will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with total
protection from breath attacks becoming a possibility, though, unless
the breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
triangle it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of triangles in the
process.

While the triangles orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for
every triangle active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including
spells. The mage may create fewer triangles than the maximum possible.
The material component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for
every triangle created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they
disappear and are replaced by the floating triangles.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Sarius' Mage Ward (Enchantment, Alteration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One amulet
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used to create a magical amulet which, when worn or
possessed by a creature, will cause all spells cast by the amulet's
creator to affect the creature with different variables of power. All
defensive or beneficial spells will have a +2 (on any applicable die or
10% if a percentage die) bonus applied to durations, areas of effect,
ranges, or any increases in which the bonus would benefit the creature.
All attack or detrimental spells from the mage would apply with a -2
(or -10%) penalty applied to their operation against the creature. For
example, if the mage accidentally caught an ally (in possession of his
Mage Ward) in the area of effect of his Fireball the creature would
have his needed save reduced by 2 and all damage dice against the
creature would suffer a -2 penalty, possibly negating the effect on
that creature.

Also, having the amulet in their possession (knowingly or unknowingly,
but not forcibly against their will) a creature's base magic resistance
will automatically be reduced by 2% per level of the mage (at the time
of the wards creation). Possession is considered to be within 2 inches
of the creature's body.

The amulet may also be used to negate any portal or device protections
created or cast by the mage for a one round period. After 10 uses of
this nature the amulet crumbles to dust. The material component of this
spell is 10 GP weight of platinum, and a special mold made of wax and a
crushed sapphire worth at least 500 GP. Once molten, the platinum is
poured into the mold and then the spell is cast on the cooling metal.
Note that the amulet does not have to be any certain shape, and can
later have gems (whether magical or not) mounted into it through
shaping and/or settings made at the time of molding, but the amulet
must not be injured by this or one 1-7 of the charges will be used.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Shadow Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 1 yard per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly like Astral Wall, except that it additionally
forbids magical or mystical sensing through the wall. Thus,
clairvoyance, detect spells, mystical detection abilities, a basilisk's
gaze, etc. will not be able to pass through a shadow wall. Other
effects (including the duration increase) are as Astral Wall. The
material component is a piece of paper with a Blindness Glyph of
Warding or Symbol inscribed thereupon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sillvatar's Dragon Wings (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster conjures a shadowy pair of dragon
wings that appear on his body; these wings provide the caster with the
movement (flying) rate of the dragon that produced the material
component. For example, if the material component was taken from a blue
dragon, the caster would be able to fly at a rate of 30 with an MC of
C. The colour of the wings' scales will also correspond to the
appropriate type. The wings will last for 2 rounds per level of the
caster, or until dispelled.

The material component for this spell is the wing muscle from any type
of dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleep II (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level sleep except as noted. All
creatures to be effected by the sleep spell must be within the 40'
radius sphere created upon completion of casting. The sphere must be
centered on a creature or object within sight and not an area; in
addition the area of effect can not be reduced, although the caster can
specify during its casting that creatures closest to the center be
effected first dependent upon the hit dice of those creatures.

The number of creatures that can be effected is a function of the
caster's level: for every 2 levels of the caster, 1d6 hit dice, rounded
up, can be effected. Example: A fifth level wizard could affect 3d6 hit
dice of monsters. Monsters with 6 + 1 hit dice or more are uneffected.
The center of effect is determined by the caster although the caster
may not be in the area of effect upon spell completion or risk its
effects. The creatures with the least hit dice are affected first
(dependent upon the casters wishes, additionally creatures below a
certain hit dice may be excluded), and partial effects are ignored.
The material components for this spell is a pinch of fine sand and rose
pedals, or a live cricket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sonoric's Animal Awareness (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One animal
Saving Throw: Negates

With this spell, the caster is able to take control any any small (size
Tiny) creature of less than 1+ HD in his line of sight. If the creature
is above animal intelligence, it gets a saving throw versus spells, a
successful save indicating spell failure. The creature is at -4 to save
if the caster has a good grip on it for the duration of the spells
casting. Those creatures of a non-magical nature of less then animal
intelligence do not get a save. Those of a magical nature get a save at
-4.

Once the caster has control of the animal, while concentrating he can
see, hear, etc through the animal's senses. He can also control the
animal's actions, even special movement, such as flying, swimming and
burrowing, although the if the caster attempts to get the creature to
attack something not below itself on the food chain, the animal has a
(75 - minus caster's level) percent chance of escaping the grip of the
spell. While concentrating on the animal, the caster is incapable of
any other action.

The caster can maintain control of the animal up to 100 yards away, per
level of the caster. Those seeing the controlled animal will notice any
strange behaviour it may be exhibiting, if they make the appropriate
perception checks (i.e. INT check, or save versus paralysation). The
spell is broken if the caster ceases concentration, or if the animal
takes more than 4 HP of damage. Otherwise, the spell lasts for a turn
per three levels of the caster (i.e. two turns at fourth, three at
seventh, etc).

The material component of the spell is a bit of food, which the target
animal would find appetising, which is consumed by the caster in the
casting of the spell.

Sonoric's Fly on the Wall (Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a spying device out of an ordinary flying insect.
Upon casting the spell upon an insect, living or dead, the spell grants
the abilities of limited clairaudience and clairvoyance, centered on
the insect.  The mage, while concentrating on the insect, can hear any
noise within 15' of the insect. Clairvoyance through the insect,
however, is rather disorientating, and the mage is -2 to hit and AC for
three rounds after breaking concentration. The insect has a flying
movement rate of 6", and its movement is controlled by the
concentrating mage.

If concentration is broken before the end of the spell duration, the
fly drops to the ground, and there is a 75% chance that, if the mage
resumes concentration, it will be too damaged to fly again, although
the clairaudience and clairvoyance will still work for the remainder of
the duration. If the fly takes any damage during the spell, such as
being swatted or stepped on, the insect will no longer fly, but,
provided that at least half of the fly remains, the clairaudience and
clairvoyance will still work.

The material component of the spell is the body of a winged insect,
living or dead, which is slain in the casting of the spell.

Sonoric's Spying Minions (Conjuration/Summoning, Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons minor etherlings from the Ethereal Plane, to serve
the caster's wishes. Etherlings, being rather stupid and weak, are only
suited for simple tasks, such as spying. Upon summoning the creatures,
the caster must detail, in simple language, what he service he wishes
the etherlings to perform. The etherlings, in their stupidity, will be
honoured by the request for service, and will perform the task to the
best of their abilities and comprehension.

A minor etherling (AC:2 MV:60 HD:2 #AT:1 D:1-3), is a small, vaguely
humanoid appearing creature, formed of the stuff of the plane ethereal.
On the prime material plane, it appears as a hazy, humanoid- shape
ghostly apparition, about 3' tall. It moves by flying, and is
unobstructed by walls and solid objects, save lead, the touch of which
sends it back to the ethereal plane. It is fairly stupid (INT: 5),
although extremely talkative, and puppyish in its affection of the
caster. The etherling will do its best to please the caster, to the
point of becoming annoying. It does have some special abilities, making
it particularly useful, however. It has a photographic memory, and will
never forget what it saw and heard during its period of service. It
also has the ability to turn small objects (one at a time), weighing
less than five pounds, ethereal, allowing it to transport the item. It
can also turn itself invisible at will, although those able to see onto
the ethereal plane will be able to see it clearly. It can push its
movement rate up to 120, for up to a turn at a time. It can only attack
things on the ethereal plane, and even there not very effectively.
Finally, the fact that it only partially exists on the Prime Material
plane during the spell means that it is only hit by magic weapons, and
spells.

The spell summons one etherling per three levels of the caster, one at
first, two at fourth, three at seventh, etc. The caster can detail
separate task for each individual etherling summoned, and may cast the
spell more than once during its duration (allowing him to summon a
virtual horde), as the spell requires no concentration after the
initial casting.  An etherlings instructions can be facilitated by
pictures (as in "Follow this *point* man... The one in the painting" or
"Follow her *point*... The one in this Phantasmal Force"). It is up to
the DM to decide the chance of the etherling getting confused, and
screwing up the task. I suggest that it has a 100% chance of getting
the task right, -1% for each word in the description (i.e. 10 words,
70% chance), giving a bonus for things such as pictures, and other
helpful examples.  If the etherling should encounter any mentally
straining problems, such as if its "mark" (he whom it is tailing or
spying upon) teleports away, or disguises its features, casts
illusions, etc, make an intelligence check for the etherling, modified
by the situation. If the etherling fails, it is hopelessly confused,
and returns to the Ethereal plane. The caster must take care to give
the etherling tasks which it can complete within the duration of the
spell, as the etherling returns to the Ethereal Plane at the end of the
spells duration.

Some examples of tasks given to etherlings would be "Go to the chamber
at the end of the hall, stay there, and return to me in 20 minutes, to
tell me what you heard and saw.", or "Go to this room in the tower of
the castle, and bring me back a book that looks like this...", or "Find
this man, follow him for half an hour, and return to me, telling me
what you witnessed.", or "Find this man, and tell him 'Va banque. The
game is thick' ", and similar such things.  Etherlings are intelligent
enough to follow the spirit of the commands, provided they are simple
enough.  Etherlings have an innate sense of direction, and will not get
lost on the Prime Material plane. They have the mentalities of young
children.  They will only perform service on the material plane.

The material components of the spell are small figurines, one for each
etherling to be summoned. They must be fairly detailed, and are
consumed in the casting of the spell.

Spirit Skill (Enchantment)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell transfers skills from a specially prepared vessel into a
willing recipient. The material component is a symbol prepared using
Steal Skill, which must be carried by the recipient and disappears upon
completion of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steal Skill (Conjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets a wizard steal the class-related skills of a willing
humanoid victim and transfer them either to the wizard or to a special
container. The victim drops to first level, and regains levels at the
rate of 1 per four hours thereafter. The caster gains 1/2 the
class-related skills of the victim (if stealing from a fighter, the
caster will gain the ability to wear armour and attack with a THAC0
halfway between the fighter's and the default 20 with any weapon with
which the fighter is proficient; if stealing from a thief the caster
will gain thief abilities which are the average of the thief's
abilities and the base of 4; in no case will abilities go down because
of this). Abilities which are granted by a diety cannot be transferred
this way, nor can spellcasting abilities. The transferred abilities
fade after one turn per level.

The material component is a symbol of the class to be transferred,
specially prepared and costing not less than 10 GP per level of the
target. If the caster wishes, he may imbue the symbol with these skills
rather than using them at the time (in which case it will not
disappear). The primary purpose of this use is to provide the material
component for Spirit Skill.

Suppress Magic Resistance (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One source of magic resistance
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster can temporarily suppress the magic
resistance emanating from one creature or object, thus allowing other
spells and magical effects to have an increased chance of effect. The
spell affects one creature or object and the area that its magic
resistance protects. For example, this spell can be cast a paladin
wielding a holy sword that provides magic resistance in a 5' radius,
and the magic resistance can be suppressed in the entire area of
effect. If there are multiple sources of magic resistance affecting the
same area, this spell may only target one of them.

This spell can suppress up to 5% magic resistance per level of the
caster. Partial effects are possible. For example, if a 10th level
mage is casting the spell at a creature with 80% magic resistance, that
creature's magic resistance will be lowered to 30% while this spell is
in effect. Of course, this spell will not go into effect unless the
creature fails its magic resistance roll.

The caster must maintain some concentration in order to preserve the
spell's effect. The caster may not perform any actions except moving at
up to half his normal movement rate. If the caster is successfully
attacked, then his concentration is also broken. If concentration is
broken, the spell's effects terminate immediately.

The caster, however, may choose to terminate the spell in a controlled
manner, and during the last round before the spell is terminated, the
spellcaster, in addition to moving at up to half his normal movement
rate, may also cast one spell whose casting time is up to one round.
The target's magic resistance remains lowered when making its
resistance check against this spell. Of course, other spellcasters and
devices may also cast spells while the target's magic resistance is
lowered, and such magic does not terminate the suppress magic
resistance spell.

This spell will totally negate a magic resistance spell if it is
successful at suppressing magic resistance of a percentage at least as
high as the percentage given by the magic resistance spell. In such a
case, concentration by the caster is not necessary.

Teleport Trace (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S
Duration: 10 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The wizard casts this spell on a character or creature who is likely to
teleport or employ similar magic in the near future. If the recipient
does cast teleport (or dimension door, word of recall, etc.), then the
wizard who placed the teleport trace will receive a mental image of the
target location. The caster of the trace will then know his location
relative to that of the teleporter, and he will be able to use his own
teleportation or scrying magic with maximum accuracy.

Time Warp (Alteration)

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature per level

This is a combined haste and slow spell. At the time of casting, the
caster chooses which application to use. The effects, as well as range,
saving throw, and material components are as per the appropriate
spell.

Uldark's Conjured Fireball (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell duplicates the 3rd level spell Fireball in most respects;
however, instead of shaping the Fireball from magical energy as the
evocation version does, this spell actually conjures a ball of fire
directly from the elemental plane of fire.  When the spell is cast, a
small interdimensional connection opens between the plane of fire and
the caster's plane; the Fireball enters through this opening and
strikes the targets as directed by the caster.  There is a chance that
an extraplanar creature may enter through the opening as well.  The
chance of this occurring is:  20% - 1% per level of the caster (to a
minimum of 1%).

This spell has the same effects (including damage) as the evocation
version, but it is slightly harder to produce these effects in this
manner; this is reflected in the higher spell level and the reduced
range and area of effect.

The material components for this spell are a piece of flint and a pinch
of sulphur.

Uldark's Conjured Frost Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 50' long x 10' wide bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to Uldark's Conjured Lightning Bolt [q.v]. It
conjures a bolt of frost and ice from the para-elemental plane of ice.
The chance that an extraplanar creature enters the caster's plane is
the same as that of the Conjured Lightning Bolt spell. The bolt is 50
feet long and 10 feet wide; anyone hit by the bolt suffers 1d6 points
of damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). A
successful save vs. spells reduces the damage by half.

The material component for this spell is a large chunk of ice or snow;
this is consumed with the casting.

Uldark's Conjured Lightning Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 40 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to Uldark's Conjured Fireball except that it
conjures a Lightning Bolt from the quasi-elemental plane of lightning,
instead of a Fireball from the plane of fire.  The chance that an
extraplanar creature enters the caster's plane is the same as that of
the Conjured Fireball spell.  The effects of this spell are identical
to that of the normal Lightning Bolt spell, but the area of effect is
either a bolt 30' long and 10' wide, or a bolt 60' long and 5' wide.

The material components of this spell are a small metal rod and the
skin of an electric eel.

Vander's Librarian (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: One minor spirit
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures a minor knowledge spirit to search for books and
references for the wizard.  It can search for titles, specific
references, or general subject matter, finding books in the time it
would take a reasonably skilled librarian (depends on case).  The
wizard is freed to concentrate on more interesting matters, so this
spell roughly doubles a wizard's research efficiency.

Vandergast's Forcetrap (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When this spell is cast, a shimmering, blue bolt shoots from the
caster's finger towards the target; when the target is struck, the bolt
erupts into multiple bands of force that envelop the victim. If a
successful save vs.  spell is made, the spell dissipates and has no
effect; otherwise, the bands of force will render the target completely
immobile by normal means, as his hands, feet, etc. will be snuggly
bound. The target may still levitate or employ other means of magical
movement, but may not walk, cast spells requiring a somatic component,
or fight. Any size target may be affected by this spell.

The bands of force may not be harmed by weapons or most spells, but may
be dispelled; a Wish or Limited Wish will also destroy the bands. The
only other way to escape the bands is to roll a successful bend bars
check. The victim may make one such attempt each round; in addition,
*one* attempt may be made each round from an external source; if anyone
touches the bands after the first external bend bars attempt (including
another bend bars attempt, striking the bands with a weapon, etc.) the
person touching the bands is immediately trapped as well, with no save.
If two or more persons are trapped by this spell, each earns a bend
bars roll each round; however, no external attempts may be made, or
that person will also become trapped. In any case, if a bend bars roll
is successful, the bands break, and the spells ends immediately.

View Past (Divination)
Level: 4
Source:  Great Net Spellbook, V3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1/2" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast on an area, it allows the caster to create a
three-dimensional image of the past in that location. The caster
specifies the time in the past through the use of the material
component.

Ten gold pieces worth of gold dust is required for each hour back into
the past the caster wishes to go. Thus, if the caster uses 240 GP worth
of dust, then he will be able to view the period from 24 hours to the
end of the duration of the spell (e.g., if the caster was 10th level,
then the duration of the spell would be from 24 hours in the past to 22
hours and 20 minutes into the past).

After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 2D10 - 11 to determine the
error in the time frame in turns from the specified time.

The caster should roll 1D20 to determine the clarity of the casting. A
die roll of one indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a
fog. A die roll of 20 indicates a crystal clear picture. This roll can
be repeated in subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty in
seeing through time.

Both the following dice rolls can be modified by the casters desire
based on the following modifiers:

 caster participated in the event			+10
 caster very well informed of the event			+6
 caster knows an exact quote during the event		+4
 caster knows something that was said at the time	+2

Events that are cloaked by spells that hide themselves from
Clairvoyance also mask out View Past, and thus cannot be seen by this
spell.
