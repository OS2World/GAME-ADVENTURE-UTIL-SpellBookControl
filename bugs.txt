Known bugs in version 1.0:

* When double-clicking on a spell to bring up details, the newly
created window will beep if created under your cursor position.
This happens at the time of the WinShowWindow call to the MLE.
If anybody can figure this one out, great!!!

* Error handling is minimal.  The program usually crashes if
files aren't in the right format.

* Spell format requirements are still fairly rigid... needs to
be more intelligent about accepting input spells.

* When displaying the details of a spell, there are problems with
the format of tables (i.e. columns of numbers that are supposed to
line up).

* Although editing a spell and saving it "works", it doesn't work
well... change needs to be made to the original file.

* Multiple spells with the same name -> problems when loading in
spell lists.
